## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Rinse and drain the jackfruit and cut into smaller pieces, if desired.

### Step 2

Make the spice paste by combining coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fresh ginger, garlic, green chili, and black peppercorns
in a small blender and blitz until smooth. You could also use a pestle and mortar. Set the paste aside while you start
the curry.

### Step 3

Heat the vegetable oil in a pan and add the bay leaf, dried red chillies, and cumin seeds. When they start to sizzle,
add the finely chopped onions and cook on a low-to-medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, until deep golden brown.

### Step 4

Add your spice paste, cook for 1 minute, then add the finely chopped tomatoes. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the
tomatoes are nice and soft.

### Step 5

Add the salt, turmeric and jackfruit, mixing well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the jackfruit has taken on all
the flavors of the sauce. Stir in the garam masala and granulated sugar and it's ready to serve.

### Step 6

Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and reheat before serving.

!!! tip

    Fingerling pototoes would also go well with this dish.

!!! tip

    Frozen grated ginger would also work rather than fresh ginger or grated fresh ginger so that big chunks of ginger
    are not present.
