## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

If your brown rice isn’t cooked yet, start there by following this method for the best results. Otherwise, move onto
the next step.

### Step 2

Heat skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add raw walnuts and toast for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until
fragrant and golden brown. Let cool and move onto the next step.

### Step 3

In the meantime, heat the same skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and white onion. Season with a bit of salt
and pepper and sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until onion is fragrant, soft, and translucent. Remove from heat and set
aside.

### Step 4

Once walnuts are cooled, add to blender or food processor with chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, pepper and
brown sugar and blend until a fine meal is achieved. Set aside.

### Step 5

To a large mixing bowl, add drained, dried black beans and mash well with a fork, leaving only a few whole beans.

### Step 6

Next add cooked rice, spice-walnut mixture, sautéed onion, panko bread crumbs, 3 to 4 Tbsp of BBQ sauce, and mix
thoroughly with a wooden spoon for 1 to 2 minutes, or until a moldable dough forms. If dry, add an extra 1 to 2 Tbsp BBQ
sauce (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If too wet, add more panko bread crumbs.
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

### Step 7

For larger burgers, divide into 5 patties (1/2 cup in size // amount as original recipe is written), or form 10 smaller
burgers (1/4 cup in size // amount as original recipe is written). To help form the patties, line your 1/2 or 1/4
measuring cup with plastic wrap and pack with burger mixture. Press down to pack firmly, then lift out by the plastic
wrap’s edge, and slightly flatten with hands to form a 3/4-inch thick patty. Set on a baking sheet or plate for
grilling.

### Step 8

If grilling, heat the grill at this time and brush the grill surface with oil to ease cooking. Otherwise, heat the same
skillet you used earlier to medium heat.

### Step 9

Once skillet is hot, add just enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of your skillet, then add your burgers – only as
many as will comfortably fit in the pan. Otherwise, add burgers to the grill and close lid.

### Step 10

Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until well browned on the underside, then flip gently. They aren’t as firm as meat burgers,
but will definitely hold their shape. Reduce heat if cooking/browning too quickly. Cook for 3-4 minutes on other side.

### Step 11

Remove burgers from heat to let cool slightly, and prepare any other toppings/sides at this time (such as
grilling/toasting your buns).

### Step 12

Serve burgers as is, or on toasted buns with desired toppings. Leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
