## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9 x 13 x 2 inch baking pan.

### Step 2

Sift the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and kosher salt into a small bowl and set aside.

### Step 3

Place the eggs, 1 cup of granulated sugar, and the vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment and beat on medium-high speed for 10 minutes (really!) until light yellow and fluffy.

### Step 4

Reduce the speed to low and slowly add half the flour mixture, then the whole milk, and finally the remaining flour
mixture. Mix with a rubber spatula to be sure the batter is well mixed.

### Step 5

Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake for 25 minutes, until the cake springs back when touched
lightly in the middle and a cake tester comes out clean.

### Step 6

Set aside to cool in the pan for 30 minutes.

### Step 7

In a 4 cup liquid measuring cup, whisk together the heavy cream, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, almond
extract, and vanilla bean seeds.

### Step 8

Using a bamboo skewer, poke holes all over the cooled cake and slowly pour the cream mixture over the cake, allowing it
to be absorbed completely before continuing to pour on more of the mixture.

### Step 9

Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.

### Step 10

To serve, toss the fruit with the 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar. Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar, cut in
squares, and place on dessert plates. Surround the cake with the fruit, put a dollop of whipped cream on top, and serve.

### Step 11

Place the cold heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, granulated sugar, creme fraîche, and vanilla in the bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.

### Step 12

Beat on high speed, until it forms soft peaks.

### Step 13

Serve cold.
