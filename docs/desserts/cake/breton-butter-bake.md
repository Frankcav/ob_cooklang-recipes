## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 8-inch springform pan or 9-inch fluted tart pan

- 1 rubber spatula

- 1 pastry brush
- 1 cake plate

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Line an 8-inch springform pan or 9-inch fluted tart pan with a round of parchment.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, cream the unsalted European butter and granulated sugar together using handheld electric beaters
for roughly 4 minutes, until pale and not fluffy. The idea isn't to incorporate large amounts of air into the cake as it
is meant to be dense and decadent. One by one, beat in the five room temperature egg yolks until all are fully
incorporated. Add the dark rum or orange flower water and beat to combine.

### Step 3

Place a sieve over the mixing bowl and sift in the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Give the
mixture a quick fold with a rubber spatula, then beat briefly on low until no streaks of flour remain.

### Step 4

Transfer the batter - it will be thick and tacky - to the baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap. Use the palm of your hand
to lightly smooth the top. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 5

Lightly whisk the whole egg with the milk. Remove the pan form the fridge, discard the plastic wrap and, using a pastry
brush, brush the top of the cake with the egg wash. Drag the tines of a fork across the surface in a crisscrossing
diamond pattern. Give the cake another light brushing of egg wash. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 325°F
and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cake is a rich golden brown and the edges have started to pull away
from the sides of the pan.

### Step 6

Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before moving it to a cake plate. Your slices will be neater if you
slice the cake while still warm. The cake can be eaten warm or at room temperature. Serve with a generous dollop of
[crème fraiche][2].

!!! tip "Jam Variation"

    If you'd like to try this with a layer of [jam][3], fill the prepared tart pan with half the batter, freeze
    for 10 minutes, add 3/4 cup of jam (optional), freeze for another 10 minutes and add the final layer of batter. It
    will need 45 minutes total baking time.
