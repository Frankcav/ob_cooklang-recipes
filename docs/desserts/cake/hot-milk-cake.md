## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9×13-inch baking pan with baking spray.

### Step 2

Heat the whole milk and unsalted butter in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally, just until bubbling and butter is
melted, about 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

### Step 4

In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the granulated sugar and eggs
on medium-high until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour mixture and beat on low until just incorporated. With the
mixer running on low, gradually pour in the hot milk mixture. Stir in vanilla extract. Pour batter into the prepared
baking pan.

### Step 5

Bake for 28 to 32 minutes or until lightly browned, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake
cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar before slicing and serving.
