## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

reheat the oven to 350°F and coat the loaf pan with butter. Line with parchment paper and sprinkle Demerara sugar on
the bottom and sides of the pan.

### Step 2

Choose the thinnest rhubarb stalks, or trim accordingly, making about 4 to 5 pieces that are about 8.5 inches in length.
Set these pieces aside.

### Step 3

Chop up the remaining rhubarb into 1/2 inch pieces. Transfer 227 g into a small saucepan and set aside the remaining 113
g to fold into the batter later.

### Step 4

Add 1 Tbsp water to the saucepan and cook the chopped rhubarb over medium heat, stirring often and mashing with the back
of a wooden spoon, until the pieces have broken down. Claire notes the mixture should begin to resemble applesauce,
which will take about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Once the mixture is cooled, stir in the
baking soda, it will bubble and turn a grayish color which is normal! Set mixture aside.

### Step 5

In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.

### Step 6

In a large mixing bowl, massage the orange zest with the granulated sugar until it looks like wet sand.

### Step 7

Stir in the melted unsalted butter, and room temperature eggs.

### Step 8

Whisk in the whole-milk Greek yogurt, vanilla, and rhubarb mush until smooth. Scrape the bowl as needed until all the
dry ingredients disappear.

### Step 9

Switch to a flexible spatula and fold in the remaining 113 g of chopped rhubarb into the batter.

### Step 10

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Place the reserved rhubarb stalks over the top of the batter
in parallel lines. Sprinkle with Demerara sugar, or regular sugar, and bake for 60 minutes.

### Step 11

Reduce the temp to 325°F and cook for an additional 30 to 40 minutes or until the cake tester comes out clean. Tent the
top with foil if it starts to get too brown.

### Step 12

Let cool for 20 minutes in the pan before removing it from the pan and letting it cool completely.
