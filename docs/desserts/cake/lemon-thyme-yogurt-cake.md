### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour an 8.5 x 4.5-inch loaf pan.

### Step 2

Combine the 1.5 jars of granulated sugar and lemon zest in a bowl and, using your fingertips, rub them together to
distribute the citrus oils.

### Step 3

Whisk the 1 jar of whole plain yogurt and eggs together. Add the zesty sugar and whisk to thoroughly combine. Add the 3
jars of all-purpose or cake flour, baking powder, salt and lemon thyme leaves and whisk just to combine. Add the 1 jar
of olive oil and whisk until homogeneous.

### Step 4

Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

### Step 5

Prepare the glaze by mixing the lemon juice or juice of 1 lemon plus 1 Tbsp limoncello (alternative) and 30 to 60 g of
confectioners' sugar together until smooth. Drizzle this over the cake once it has come to room temperature. Scatter the
lemon thyme leaves, for decoration.

!!! note

    Substitute thyme (alternative), rosemary (alternative), verbana (alternative), or tarragon (alternative).

!!! note

    This recipe can be made in an 8-inch springform or a 9-inch round cake pan. A 9-inch cake will only take around 30
    to 35 minutes to take, whereas and 8-inch round will take closer to 40 and medium loaf between 35 and 45 minutes.
