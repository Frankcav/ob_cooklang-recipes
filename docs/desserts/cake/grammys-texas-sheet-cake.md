## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease and flour a half sheet pan (13×18"). See notes for additional size options.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of granulated sugar, 1 tsp baking soda and
1 tsp salt.

### Step 3

In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine 8 Tbsp unsalted butter, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 1
cup of water and heat until melted. Add butter mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until incorporated.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl (or the saucepan that you just emptied), whisk together 2 eggs, 1 cup buttermilk and 1 Tbsp vanilla.
Gradually add to the butter mixture and stir until fully incorporated.

### Step 5

Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cake is fragrant and springs when you
press it.

### Step 6

While cake is baking, melt 2 Tbsp unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Add 2 cups of chopped
pecans to the butter and toast, stirring occasionally, until golden and fragrant, about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from
saucepan and let cool.

### Step 7

In the same saucepan (no need to wash), combine 8 Tbsp unsalted butter, 4 oz cream cheese, 4 cups confectioners' sugar
and 3 Tbsp cocoa powder and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until melted. Remove from heat, stir in 1 Tbsp
vanilla, then pour over the warm (but not hot) cake. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the top.

### Step 8

Cake is best served the day it's made. Wrapped well or put in an airtight container, cake will last 1 to 2 days at room
temperature or up to a week in the fridge.

!!! note

    Texas sheet cake is traditionally baked in a 13×18″ half sheet pan. You may also use a jelly roll pan
    (typically 10.5×15.5″) but will likely need to add 5-10 additional minutes of bake time (I haven’t tried this
    iteration). If you’d like to use a 9×13 pan, I’d recommend baking at 350 for at least 30 minutes and adding
    additional time as needed.

!!! note

    If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can sub an equal volume of 1 part milk to sour cream or Greek yogurt.
    In a pinch, you can sub 1 cup of buttermilk for 1 cup of milk (ideally whole milk, but any kind will work) with 1
    tablespoon of milk replaced with vinegar.
