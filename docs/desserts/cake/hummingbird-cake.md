## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 8-inch cake pans
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 large bowl
- 1 medium bowl
- 1 stand mixer
- 1 wire rack

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).

### Step 2

Toast the pecans for 8 to 10 minutes then pulverize them.

### Step 3

Grease three 8-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps
the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.

### Step 4

Whisk the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and 1.5 cups toasted pecans (Save the
rest for garnish.) together in a large bowl.

### Step 5

Combine the mashed ripe bananas, crushed pineapple, and vanilla in a medium bowl.

### Step 6

Cream the eggs, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar until pale and fluffy and it creates a slowly dissolving ribbon
in a stand mixer.

### Step 7

Combine the vegetable oil slowly to the bowl in the stand mixer so that it emulsifies into the batter.

### Step 8

Switch to the paddle attachment in the stand mixer.

### Step 9

Alternate pouring the dry then wet ingredients into the batter, starting and ending with dry. You should have about 6 to
7 cups of batter.

### Step 10

Spread batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake pans. Bake for 26 to 29 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean. Rotate pans halfway through baking.

### Step 11

Remove cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. Once completely cooled, remove
cakes from pan and level the tops off so they are flat. I simply use a serrated knife. Discard the tops or eat.

### Step 12

In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the
cream cheese and unsalted butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners'
sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3
minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioner's sugar if frosting is too thin, a little milk if
frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.

!!! note

    [Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting][2] may be used instead of this frosting. Use a half serving for a 2 tiered cake.

### Step 13

First, using a large serrated knife or cake leveler, layer off the tops of the cakes to create a
flat surface. Place 1 cake layer on your cake turntable, cake stand, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with
frosting. Top with 2nd layer, more frosting, and then top with the 3rd layer. Spread remaining frosting all over the top
and sides. Decorate the sides and top of the cake with the remaining toasted pecans. Refrigerate cake for at least 15 to
20 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.

### Step 14

Cover leftover frosted cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
