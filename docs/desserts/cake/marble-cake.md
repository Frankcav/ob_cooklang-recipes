## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust the oven rack to middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F / 180°C. Butter and flour (or generously spray
with a non-stick cooking spray) a 10-cup bundt pan (*see note).

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a liquid measuring cup (or a small bowl) whisk together the sour cream and whole milk. Set aside.

### Step 4

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl and an electric hand mixer), beat
the unsalted butter on medium speed until creamy, ribbon-like and slightly lightened up; 2 to 3 minutes.

### Step 5

With the mixer running on medium-low speed, gradually add in the granulated sugar. Raise the speed to medium-high and
continue beating together until lightened up in both color and texture; 4 to 5 minutes. The color should turn very pale
(almost white) and texture should look fluffy.

### Step 6

Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in the vanilla and beat together for 1
minute.

### Step 7

On lowest speed, add in one-third of the flour mixture and mix until mostly combined. Add in half of the sour cream/milk
mixture and lightly stir until almost mixed in. Continue with adding another one-third of the flour mixture, followed by
the remaining sour cream and ending with the last third of flour mixture. Mix until just combined and a smooth batter
forms. Do not overmix. With a rubber spatula, give the batter one good, final stir to make sure that everything is well
incorporated.

### Step 8

Remove 1.5 cups of the batter from the bowl and set aside.

### Step 9

In a medium bowl, combine the whole milk, unsalted butter and granulated sugar and heat in the microwave until the
butter has melted. Whisk to dissolve the sugar. Add in the cocoa powder and stir really well until there are no lumps
and a very thick chocolate paste forms. Add in the baking soda and stir again.

### Step 10

Take a few tablespoons from the reserved vanilla cake batter and stir really well into the chocolate paste to lighten it
up. Add the remaining reserved cake batter into the chocolate mixture and fold until evenly incorporated and no light
streaks remain.

!!! note

    The following method of marbling creates a cake with subtle marbleness, meaning that the vanilla and chocolate
    portions are more distinct in 2 different ends like a yin yang, instead of them being thoroughly mixed in a
    zebra-like pattern. It's just a matter of preference. Please see note below for a more layered marbling effect.

### Step 11

Transfer the vanilla cake batter into the prepared pan, then using the back of a spoon, make a tunnel in the middle,
around the pan. Spoon the chocolate batter into the tunnel, avoiding the sides. Using a butter knife, swirl the 2
batters together in an 'S' shape motion.

### Step 12

Bake in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the center springs back to the touch and a skewer inserted down the
center of the cake comes out clean or with a few moist but cooked crumbs attached.

### Step 13

Allow to cool in the pan for 20 minutes then invert on to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Step 14

Serve plain or dust with powered sugar or drizzle with the milk chocolate ganache glaze (recipe below) if you prefer.

### Step 15

The cake will keep for 3 days stored in air-tight container, at room temperature.

### Step 16

In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine together white chocolate and semisweet or bittersweet chocolate and heat in the
microwave, stirring every 15 seconds, until almost completely melted; about 1.5 minutes.

### Step 17

Remove from the microwave and stir until completely melted.

### Step 18

Pour the hot heavy whipping cream on top of the chocolates and stir until completely smooth. It will look broken at the
beginning but will come together just fine as you continue to stir. If you'd like, press the glaze through a fine-mesh
strainer for a smoother finish.

### Step 19

Allow the ganache to cool a bit, until it mounds slightly before smoothly disappearing; about 0.5 hour.

### Step 20

Use the glaze right away or cover until ready to use, reheating it in 3 second bursts in the microwave until desired
consistency is achieved.
