## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour an 8.5 x 4.5-inch loaf pan.

### Step 2

Combine the 2 jars of granulated sugar and orange zest in a bowl and, using your fingertips, rub them together to
distribute the citrus oils.

### Step 3

Whisk the 1 jar of whole plain yogurt and room temperature eggs together. Add the zesty sugar and vanilla and whisk to
thoroughly combine. Add the 3 jars of all-purpose or cake flour, baking powder, and salt and whisk just to combine. Add
the 1 jar of canola oil and whisk just until homogeneous.

### Step 4

Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

### Step 5

Prepare the soaking syrup by heating the Grand Marnier and orange juice in a microwave until warm, but not hot. Stir in
the superfine sugar to dissolve. Drizzle this over the cake while still warm.

### Step 6

To make the glaze, warm the apricot jam or marmalade with the rum or water over low heat. Strain. Brush into the cake
once it has cooled to room temperature.

!!! note

    This recipe can be made in an 8-inch springform or a 9-inch round cake pan. A 9-inch cake will only take around 30
    to 35 minutes to take, whereas and 8-inch round will take closer to 40 and medium loaf between 35 and 45 minutes.
