### Step 2

Set up a double boiler. You don't need an actual double boiler you can assemble your own with equipment you already
have: bring an inch or two of water to a simmer, not a boil because youâ€™re going for gentle heat, and then place a bowl
with your ingredients inside over top. You want it to fit snugly without touching the water (if it dips into the water,
it will get too hot). So in this case, add the chopped chocolate, heavy cream, sugar, butter, vanilla and salt to the
bowl over the simmering pot of water.

### Step 3

Stir until everything is melted and smooth.

### Step 4

Remove the bowl from the pot, set aside and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

### Step 5

Once cooled, pour onto the tart shell.

### Step 6

Refrigerate for 6 hours or ideally overnight until it is set.

### Step 7

Slice the chocolate tart, serve with whipped cream, fresh berries and flaky sea salt on top. Enjoy!

!!! tip

    This tart goes really well with a [mixed berry sorbet][3].

!!! tip "Variation"

    About 75 g of homemade [praline][4] and a splash of brandy sprinkled over the pastry case before it is filled are quite
    delicious. Or, try orange zest and a splash of Cointeau.
