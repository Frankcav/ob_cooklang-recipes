## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Soak the raisins in water or rum.

### Step 2

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Brush a 6 to 8 cups (1.5 - 2 L) baking dish with melted unsalted butter, and pour 3
Tbsp (45 g) over the day-old bread and toss in a large bowl.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolk and granulated sugar and then whisk in the milk, whipping cream, vanilla,
nutmeg and salt.  Pour this over the day old bread, toss to coat, and let sit for about 15 minutes, stirring once or
twice. It may look like a lot of liquid, but it all balances out.

### Step 4

After sitting for the required time, use a potato masher or slotted spoon to break down the bread pieces a bit.

### Step 5

Drain the soaking raisins and stir them into the pudding mixture. Pour this into the buttered baking dish and sprinkle
with [cinnamon sugar][2]. Bake, uncovered, for about 60 minutes, until the pudding soufflés a little and the top turn a
golden brown.

### Step 6

Allow the pudding to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

### Step 7

The bread pudding can be served warm or chilled.
