## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Thoroughly whisk sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, lime zest, egg yolks, and salt together, and set aside to thicken
while you prepare the crust.

### Step 2

Preheat oven to 350ºF.

### Step 3

Process the graham crackers in a food processor to fine crumbs. Add the granulated sugar and salt, and pulse to combine.
Last, add in the unsalted butter and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand.

### Step 4

Press the mixture into a 9 inch pie dish (metal works best here) evenly on the bottom and up the sides. I like to use a
dry measuring cup to help this along. Bake the crust until it is light golden brown and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes.

### Step 5

Cool the crust slightly, then give the prepared filling a final mix, and pour it into the pie pan. Turn the oven down to
325°F, and bake the pie until just set, but slightly wiggly in the center, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool the pie to room
temperature, then set it in the fridge to chill completely, at least 3 hours or overnight.

### Step 6

Just before serving, whip the cream to soft peaks, and spread it on top of the pie.
