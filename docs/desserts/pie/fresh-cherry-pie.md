## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make the [deluxe butter pastry][1] and shape the crust in a pie pan ahead of time, then store covered in the fridge.

### Step 2

Make the filling: In a large bowl, stir the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla, and almond extract
together until thoroughly combined. Cover filling and place in the refrigerator as you roll out the pie dough or
for up to 24 hours.

### Step 3

Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other
one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches
in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is
smooth. Use a slotted spoon to spoon and spread the cherries into the crust. Reserve the juice for the next step.
Refrigerate pie, uncovered, as you reduce the juices in the next step.

### Step 4

Pour the few Tablespoons of leftover juice into a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir for 3-4 minutes or until
juice has slightly reduced and thickened. Cool for 5 minutes, then pour over cherries in filling. Do your best to
gently toss together—doesn’t have to be perfect. The reduction will harden and thicken as a result of mixing with the
cold cherries. This is normal and it will melt again in the oven. Dot the pieces of butter on top of the filling.

### Step 5

Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).

### Step 6

Arrange the lattice: Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the refrigerator. Roll the dough into a circle
that is 12 inches diameter. Using a pastry wheel, sharp knife, or pizza cutter, cut strips of dough—I cut four strips
2 inches wide and two strips 1 inch wide. Carefully thread the strips over and under one another, pulling back strips
as necessary to weave. Press the edges of the strips into the bottom pie crust edges to seal. Use a small paring
knife to trim off excess dough. Flute or crimp the pie crust edges with a fork.

### Step 7

Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar, if using.

### Step 8

Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down
to 375°F (190°C) and bake for an additional 30-40 minutes or until the top crust is golden brown and the filling juices
have been bubbling up around the edges or through the lattice/vents for at least 5 minutes. **After the first 20
minutes of bake time, I recommend placing a pie crust shield on the crust’s edges to prevent it from over-browning too
quickly.**

### Step 9

Remove pie from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and cool for at least 3-4 hours before slicing and serving. Filling
will be too juicy if the pie is warm when you slice it.

### Step 10

Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
