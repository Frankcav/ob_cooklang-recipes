## :salt: Ingredients - Filling

- :candy: 198 g granulated sugar
- :ear_of_rice: 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- :dash: 2 tsp cream of tartar
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :egg: 3 large eggs

- :lemon: 2 tsp lemon zest
- :lemon: 0.67 cup lemon juice
- :butter: 4 Tbsp unsalted butter

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 foil
- 1 8 inch square baking pan
- 1 bowl
- 1 fine-mesh strainer

## :pencil: Instructions - Crust

### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°F. Make foil sling for 8 inch square baking pan
by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each
other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to
pan.

### Step 2

Whisk all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, and salt together in bowl. Add melted unsalted butter and stir until
combined. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and press into even layer over entire bottom of pan (do not wash bowl). Bake
crust until dark golden brown, 19 to 24 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.

### Step 3

While crust bakes, whisk granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, cream of tartar, and salt together in
now-empty bowl. Whisk in eggs and egg yolks until no streaks of egg remain. Whisk in lemon zest and lemon juice (4
lemons). Transfer mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and
registers 160°F, about 5 to 8 minutes. Off heat, stir in unsalted butter cut into 8 pieces. Strain filling through
fine-mesh strainer set over bowl.

### Step 4

Pour filling over hot crust and tilt pan to spread evenly. Bake until filling is set and barely jiggles when pan is
shaken, 8 to 12 minutes. (Filling around perimeter of pan may be slightly raised.) Let bars cool completely, at least
1.5 hours. Using foil overhang, lift bars out of pan and transfer to cutting board. Cut into bars, wiping knife clean
between cuts as necessary. Before serving, dust bars with confectioners' sugar (optional), if using.
