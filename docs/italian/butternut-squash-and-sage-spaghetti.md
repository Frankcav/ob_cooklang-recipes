## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

Cut the butternut squash (pumpkin) in half, remove seeds and drizzle with olive oil. Place in oven skin side up along
with garlic cloves. Bake at 350°F for 50 to 60 minutes or until soft.

### Step 3

In a frying pan on high heat, add enough olive oil to cover the bottom and once hot, fry your sage leaves on each side
until crispy. Set aside on kitchen towel or paper.

### Step 4

Meanwhile get your pasta water ready. Bring to the boil with enough salt. Try and time your pasta cooking time so it’s
ready at the same time the pumpkins are soft. Cook your pasta 2 minutes less than al dente.

### Step 5

Once pumpkins are cooked, remove skins and place the flesh in blender, add the garlic clove flesh, simply by squeezing
the skins, add half a lemon juice, the Mascarpone cheese, some grated nutmeg, salt & pepper, and two to three cups of
the pasta cooking water, blitz all ingredients until smooth.

### Step 6

In a large frying pan on high heat, add a little olive oil, chili flakes and shredded sage leaves. Fry for 30 seconds to
release the aromas. Pour the blended butternut content into the pan. Drain and transfer pasta directly to sauce. Mix
well, you may need to add a little more of the pasta cooking water for a saucy consistency. Cook 2 minutes until al
dente.

### Step 7

Turn heat off, add three quarter cup of grated pecorino cheese, mix again taste for seasoning, adjust if required, mix
and serve immediately.

### Step 8

Garnish with grated pecorino cheese and crispy fried sage leaves.
