- :leafy_green: 5 cups baby spinach

## :salt: Ingredients - Eggs

- :oil_drum: 0.5 Tbsp vegetable oil

- :salt: 0.13 tsp salt

## :salt: Ingredients - For Serving

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 small saucepan
- 1 medium rimmed skillet

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a non-stick sheet (use more baking
sheets if making a larger batch).

### Step 2

Add the cubed butternut squash to the baking sheet. Drizzle with vegetable oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and
garlic powder. Use clean hands to toss and evenly coat.

### Step 3

Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes or until browned and fork tender. Toss at the 15 minute mark for more even cooking.

### Step 4

Meanwhile, to a small saucepan, add the drained and rinsed [black beans][3] and heat over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes,
stirring often, until warmed through. Add [enchilada sauce][2], mix well to combine, and turn the heat to the lowest
setting to keep warm. Alternatively, microwave beans for 1 to 2 minutes and add sauce.

### Step 5

In a medium rimmed skillet add 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil and the red pepper flakes (optional). Heat over medium heat until
sizzling gently. Add the baby spinach and toss to evenly distribute the oil and red pepper flakes. Cook, tossing
occasionally, until the spinach is wilted and reduced — about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the salt and garlic
powder. Set aside if making eggs, otherwise, cover to keep warm.

### Step 6

In the now-empty skillet, add 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. Once hot, add the eggs. Crack each egg
into the pan, cook for 3 minutes uncovered, sprinkle with salt, then cover with a lid for another 1 to 2 minutes to help
the whites cook while keeping the yolks soft. Alternatively, scramble or cook to desired doneness. Remove from heat and
cover to keep warm.

### Step 7

Once the squash is roasted, assemble! Divide the squash, beans, spinach, and eggs (optional) between bowls and top each
with remaining [enchilada sauce][2], sliced avocado, and cilantro (optional). Enjoy!

### Step 8

Leftovers (excluding eggs) keep well (without sauce) for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator. Not freezer friendly.
