## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1
cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.

### Step 2

In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sour cream or full fat Greek yogurt until completely smooth.

### Step 3

Then mix in the vanilla, maple syrup, and vegetable oil followed by the unsalted butter and then buttermilk.

### Step 4

Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and gently whisk to combine. Stop right when the batter is
fully combined – careful not to over mix.

### Step 5

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. This will give the leaveners a head
start, so each muffin bakes with a tall muffin top in the oven. If you’re in a rush, you can bake the batter right
away. They just won’t be as domed on top.

### Step 6

After 1 hour, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a muffin (or cupcake) tin with 12 paper liners.

### Step 7

Using an ice cream scoop, gently run the scoop through the bowl of batter. You’ll notice the batter is very fluffy, so
be careful not to disrupt this as you scoop. Just run the scoop through the bowl and pull out the batter. Don’t mix it
around or bother it too much.

### Step 8

Over fill each liner just a smidge. You may have about 1 scoop of batter leftover which is to be expected.

### Step 9

Top each muffin with a sprinkle of coarse sugar and a pile of mini chocolate chips. Really lay on those chocolate chips
as they’ll disperse and spread as the muffins grow.

### Step 10

Bake at 425°F for 8 minutes. Then, with the oven door still closed, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for
another 8 to 10 minutes. You do not need to wait for the temperature to reach 350°F to continue baking, simply just
adjust the temperature down to 350°F and set a timer for 8 to 10 minutes.

### Step 11

Quickly test a muffin with a toothpick to see if they’re ready, but try not to keep the oven door open for too long as
you do not want the hot air to escape.

### Step 12

Remove the muffins and let them cool for 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer each muffin to a cooling rack. The muffins
may stick to the pan around the bottom edges, so just use a knife to pop them loose if needed.

### Step 13

Let the muffins cool for another 10 to 15 minutes. They’re best served warm so enjoy!
