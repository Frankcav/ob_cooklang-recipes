- 1 medium saucepan
- 1 medium bowl
- 1 whisk
- 1 medium bowl
- 1 stand mixer
- 1 parchment
- 1 rimmed baking sheet

- 1 3.25 inch round cookie cutter

- 1 wire rack
- 1 large pot
- 1 deep-fry thermometer

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Bring apple cider to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until liquid is thick, syrupy, and
reduced to about ½ cup. This will take about 20 minutes. Scrape into a medium bowl and whisk in [apple butter][2], sour
cream, and vanilla until incorporated; set aside.

### Step 2

Whisk all-purpose flour, kosher salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg, in a medium bowl.

### Step 3

Using an electric hand beater or stand mixer, beat 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 2 eggs on
medium-high speed, until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add melted unsalted butter and mix for another 1
minute.

### Step 4

Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients in 2 additions, alternating with cider mixture in 2 additions,
starting with dry ingredients and ending with cider mixture (dough will be very soft and sticky).

### Step 5

Scrape dough onto a parchment lined rimmed baking sheet thoroughly dusted with flour (about 1/3 cup). Dust hands and top
of dough with more flour, then gently pat dough to into a 3/4" thick rectangle. Dust with more flour and tightly cover
with plastic wrap; chill dough at least 3 hours, or up to overnight.

### Step 6

Make cinnamon sugar: Whisk 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 Tablespoon cinnamon in a small bowl until no lumps remain.

### Step 7

While dough is chilling, cut 10 squares of parchment paper, each about 4 inches square. This will make transferring
donuts into hot oil much easier. Working on baking sheet, punch out as many rounds as you can with the donut cutter or
3.25 inch round cookie cutter. Dip cutter into bowl of flour before each cut. If you used the 3¼ inch round cookie
cutter, you will need to use the 1.25" cutter to punch out center of each round. Place each donut on a 4 inch square of
parchment paper.

### Step 8

Gather doughnut scraps, reserving holes, and gently re-roll without overworking dough; repeat until all dough has been
used (you should have 10 doughnuts).

### Step 9

Set a wire rack inside a paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet. Fit a large pot with deep-fry thermometer and pour in
vegetable oil to a depth of 3". Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F. Working in batches, fry
doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared rack and let cool slightly. Fry
doughnut holes until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared rack and let cool slightly. Toss
warm doughnuts and doughnut holes in cinnamon sugar.
