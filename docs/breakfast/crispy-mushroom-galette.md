- 1 parchment paper

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment
paper and set aside.

### Step 2

In a medium skillet (preferably cast-iron), heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add
the leeks and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue
to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water to the skillet as needed if the leeks are starting to brown,
until they're very tender and starting to break down, another 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and
stir in the grainy Dijon mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Scrape the mixture into a medium bowl and set aside to
cool.

### Step 3

Wipe out the skillet and set it back on the stove for the mushrooms.

### Step 4

Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the same skillet and heat over high heat until shimmering. Add half of the
shiitake, cremini, oyster, and/or maitake mushrooms, 2 of the smashed garlic cloves, and 1 of the rosemary  sprigs. Toss
the mushrooms once just to coat in oil, then let them cook undisturbed until they're browned in spots, about 3 minutes.
Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned all over, have released their liquid, and are
tender, 5 to 8 minutes longer. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Scrape into a separate medium bowl and set the
bowl aside to cool. Repeat the process in the same skillet with 2 more tablespoons of oil, the remaining mushrooms, 2
smashed garlic cloves, rosemary sprig, and more salt and pepper. Reserve the skillet again for toasting the panko.

### Step 5

Unwrap the [flaky olive oil dough][2], place it on a lightly floured surface, and lightly dust the top with more flour.
Roll out the dough, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, into a round about 12 inches in diameter. If
it starts to shrink back as you're trying to roll it, cover the dough and let it rest on the surface for 10 minutes,
then proceed.

### Step 6

Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Spread the cooled leek mixture across the surface of the dough, leaving
a 1-inch border all the way around. Scatter the cooked mushrooms and garlic (discard the rosemary) over the leeks.

### Step 7

Using the parchment paper to help you, fold the sides of the pastry up and over the mushrooms, leaving the center open
and creating a series of evenly spaced pleats all the way around. Press firmly on the pleats to help the pastry adhere
to itself, then brush the exterior of the pastry with more olive oil. Sprinkle more salt and pepper across the entire
surface of the tart.

### Step 8

Bake the galette until the pastry is golden brown and the tops of the mushrooms are crispy, 45 to 55 minutes.

### Step 9

While the galette is baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the panko bread
crumbs, nutritional yeast, 1 grated garlic, and 1 Tbsp rosemary leaves and cook, stirring constantly, until the panko is
golden brown and the mixture is very fragrant, about 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, season the mixture
with salt and pepper, and scrape it onto a paper towel-lined plate to cool.

### Step 10

Finish the galette and serve: Remove the galette from the oven and let it cool before topping with the garlicky panko
and cutting into slices. Serve warm or at room temperature.
