## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To a cast iron pan over medium heat, add Greek Chickpeas with Parsley & Cumin and all the oil in the can. When oil is
hot, add the red onion and red bell pepper, and saut√© until the onions begin to brown and the peppers soften, about 5
to 10 minutes, depending on the strength of your heat source. Season with Smoked Paprika and 21 Seasoning Salute.

### Step 2

Use a spatula to create four individual pockets throughout the hash. Crack the eggs into each pocket. For eggs with a
runny yolk, cook until egg whites have set, about 3 to 5 minutes. For a firmer yolk, cook a few more minutes.
