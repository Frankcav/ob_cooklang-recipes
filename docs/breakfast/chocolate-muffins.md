## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 400°F.

### Step 2

Line jumbo, 6-ounce muffin cups with paper muffin liners.

### Step 3

In the large bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the unsalted butter, granulated sugar and canola oil
until light and creamy. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined.

### Step 4

Add the eggs one at a time and beat just until combined.

### Step 5

Beat in the dry chocolate pudding mix until blended.

### Step 6

In a separate bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking soda, baking powder, kosher salt and dark cocoa powder to
ensure there are no lumps.

### Step 7

On low speed, add the dry ingredients into the butter mixture in two installments, alternating with the sour cream. Beat
just until combined and no flour streaks are visible. Next, beat in the buttermilk until just combined. Fold in the 1
1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chunks.

### Step 8

Scoop the batter into the lined muffin cups. You want them pretty full and a nice dome shape. I like to add a few more
chocolate chunks on the top before baking.

### Step 9

Place the muffins in the oven on 400°F for 5 minutes, then leave the muffins in the oven and lower the temperature to
325°F for approximately 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out of the center clean.

### Step 10

In a small saucepan, add the bittersweet chocolate chips and condensed milk. Head over medium heat, stirring constantly
until the chips are melted. Whisk in the vanilla extract and then pour the ganache into a pastry bag.

### Step 11

Using a paring knife, remove about a 1 inch round section of the center of each muffin. Pipe some of the ganache into
each muffin hole and enjoy!
