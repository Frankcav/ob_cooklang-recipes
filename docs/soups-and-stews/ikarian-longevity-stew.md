- :herb: 4 bay leaves
- :canned_food: 16 oz black-eyed peas
- :seedling: 2 bunches chopped dill
- :garlic: 2 fennel bulbs
- :garlic: 8 garlic cloves

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat half the olive oil over medium heat and cook the red onion, garlic, and fennel bulb stirring occasionally, until
soft (about 12 minutes). Add the black-eyed peas and toss to coat in the oil.

### Step 2

Add the tomato, tomato paste and enough water or vegetable broth to cover the beans by about an inch. Add the bay leaves.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the black-eyed peas are about half way cooked. (Check after 40 minutes,
but it may take over an hour.)

### Step 3

Add the chopped dill and season with salt.

### Step 4

Continue cooking until the black-eyed peas are tender. Remove, pour in remaining raw olive oil and serve.

!!! tip "Slow Cooker"

    If cooking in a slow cooker, double the recipe except for vegetable broth, use 6 cups. Cook on high for 9 hours.
