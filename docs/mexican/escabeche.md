## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, star anise, cumin seeds,
whole black peppercorns, thyme, oregano, and red pepper flakes and toast in the oil until the spices are warm and
fragrant, 2 minutes.

### Step 2

Add the yellow onion and garlic and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the apple cider
vinegar and 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Add the kosher salt and coconut sugar and stir to dissolve. Remove the
pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes.

### Step 3

In a large jar or covered container, add the mixed vegetables and the 1/4 to 1/2 jalapeño. Pour the vinegar mixture
over the vegetables, adding a little more water if necessary to top off the jar and keep the vegetables submerged. Cover
tightly and store in the refrigerator. The vegetables will need to pickle overnight before serving and will keep in the
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

### Step 4

Note: The mixed vegetables can contain zucchini, baby carrots, bell peppers, celery, broccoli, or cauliflower.
