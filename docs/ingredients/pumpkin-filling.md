### Step 1

In a large nonstick or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the thinly sliced onions and thinly
sliced cremini mushroom and cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms have given off some
moisture, about 8 minutes.

### Step 2

Reduce the heat to medium and add the diced pumpkin or butternut squash and 1/2 tsp of salt.

### Step 3

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is soft but holds its shape, about 10 minutes.

### Step 4

Add the chopped kale and the remaining 1/2 tsp salt and cook until the kale is wilted, about 3 minutes.

### Step 5

Add the chopped fresh mint and stir to combine.
