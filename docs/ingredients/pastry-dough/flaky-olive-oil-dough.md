- 1 parchment paper
- 1 plastic

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, salt, and baking powder to combine. Make a
well in the center of the dry ingredients.

### Step 2

Pour 6 tablespoons of the olive oil (2.9 oz / 83 g) into the well, and use a fork to incorporate some of the flour from
around the sides of the bowl until you have shaggy pieces. Break up the pieces with your fingertips so they're no larger
than a pea.

### Step 3

Drizzle 1/4 cup cold tap water into the bowl, stirring constantly with a fork, then switch back to your hands and knead
the mixture inside the bowl until a dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a work surface, leaving any floury bits
behind in the bowl, then add more water 1 teaspoon at a time to the bowl to bring the rest of the dough together, add it
to the rest of the dough.

### Step 4

Knead the dough a few times just until it's smooth (you don't want to work the dough too much, although the oil does
help prevent gluten development, thus protecting it against toughness). Press the dough into a 2-inch-thick square, wrap
it tightly in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

### Step 5

Roll out the dough between two large sheets of parchment paper, periodically peeling off and repositioning each piece of
the parchment, one at a time, for wrinkle-free rolling, to a 1/4-inch-thick square.

!!! tip

    You can skip the step of brushing the dough with more oil and rolling it up if you want to save time - the baked
    dough will still turn out flaky, just not as flaky.

!!! tip

    Use a firm hand to roll out the dough—this is not as delicate a pastry as pie dough, nor is it as prone to
    stickiness, since there's no butter to soften. If the dough isn't rolling out easily and stubbornly springs back, cover
    it and let it rest on the surface for 10 minutes before going over it again with the rolling pin.

!!! note

    The dough, wrapped tightly and refrigerated, will keep up to 3 days or can be frozen up to 1 month (place in a
    resealable plastic bag before freezing). Let the frozen dough thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.

### Step 6

Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and brush the remaining 1 tablespoon oil across the surface of the dough.

### Step 7

Starting at the side closest to you, fold up the dough into a flat, loose roll.

### Step 8

Flatten the roll with the heel of your hand across the entire length. Roll out the dough into a rough rectangle that's
about ¼ inch thick, then bring the left and right sides of the dough inward to fold it in thirds (this step ensures
lots of flaky layers).

### Step 9

Wrap the dough in plastic, pressing out any air, and press down on the dough with the heel of your hand to flatten it
into a ½-inch-thick disk. Refrigerate the dough until it's relaxed, at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days. It's now
ready to use.
