### Step 2

Beat and egg yolk with the vanilla and cold water in a small bowl.

### Step 3

Add the confectioners' sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and almond flour to a food processor and pulse.

### Step 4

Add the 1/2" cubed cold unsalted butter to the food processor and pulse until it looks like coarse corn meal.

### Step 5

Add liquid ingredients to food processor and pulse.

### Step 6

Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball. Flatten with your fingers to a rectangle
and wrap in cling film. Chill for at least 1 hour before using. 15 minutes.

### Step 7

Take the dough out of the fridge and divide almost in half, about 9/16ths using a bench scraper.

### Step 8

Divide the smaller half into six equal strips and use the strips to press into the sides of the pan, ensuring to
press the dough into the bottom corner. Using the leftovers from the six strips, fill in some of the cracks where
the dough strips come together.

### Step 9

Divide the slightly larger half of the dough and cut it into many thin pieces and press those strips into the bottom
of the pan.

### Step 10

Using floured fingers, or a straight sided measuring cup, press and thin the dough into the pan. Use the measuring
cup to press the dough into the fluted edge of the pan.

### Step 11

Pop the dough into the freezer for 5 minutes.

### Step 12

Use a knife to trim the top edge of the pan.

!!! tip

### Step 13

Take aluminum foil and press it into the bottom of the pan and press the foil up the sides of the pan. Ensure to
keep the top edge of the crust exposed to make it easier to tell when the crust is done in the oven.

!!! note

Parbake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes.

### Step 15

Remove the foil and bake a little longer, until the bottom is set.
