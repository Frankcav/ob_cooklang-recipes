## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put the unsweetened applesauce and cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and mace (optional) into a
heavy bottomed saucepan. You want a heavy pot because that will help prevent the thick apple butter from scorching on
the bottom of the pan as it cooks. Stir to combine everything and bring up to a boil.

### Step 2

Cook at a medium boil, stirring often, for about 30 to 45 minutes, until the butter is nice and thick. Be careful, the
mixture will sputter in the beginning,

!!! note

    I use a splatter guard. You don't have to stir constantly, but keep an eye on it for scorching and stir often. I
    also like to use a silicone 'spoonula' because it makes it easy to scrape the sides and bottom of the pan.

### Step 3

When it is ready, you will be able to drag a spoon across the bottom of the pan and leave a trail that will not fill in
immediately. The butter will continue to thicken as it cools.

### Step 4

For a silky apple butter, blend in a blender until smooth.

### Step 5

Put the apple butter into a jar and refrigerate. It will last several weeks. To freeze, be sure to leave 1/2 inch
headspace at the top of the jar to allow for expansion.

!!! note

    If fresh apples are to be used, slice apples into 1/4" pieces and add to slow cooker with sugar and spices and 
    cook for 10 hours on low. Puree with immersion blender until smooth. Add vanilla and cook for additional 2 hours
    uncovered, stirring occasionally.

!!! note

    If you use unsweetened apple sauce and want to sweeten your butter, add white or brown sugar, maple sugar, maple
    syrup, honey, or other sweetener (optional) to taste. Add your sweetener along with the spices to the pan at the very
    beginning.

!!! note

    There are many flavored apple sauces on the market, and you can use those, too.
