## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine white sesame seeds, dried minced onion, dried minced garlic, black sesame seeds, sea salt, and poppy seeds
thoroughly and store in an air-tight container at room temperature. Sprinkle on hard-boiled eggs, avocados, over salads,
or anything else you wish!

!!! note

    Don't make any ingredient substitutions that will change the texture of the ingredient

!!! note

    I used toasted sesame seeds which gave the blend a slightly more pronounced sesame flavor. You can use either
    toasted or untoasted.

!!! note

    If you don't want to buy black sesame seeds, you can substitute white sesame seeds and the flavor will be about
    the same.
