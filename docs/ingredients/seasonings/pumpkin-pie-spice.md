| 5 Tbsp | 5 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :custard: 3 Tbsp cinnamon
- :sweet_potato: 2 tsp ginger
- :chestnut: 1.5 tsp nutmeg (optional)
- :four_leaf_clover: 1 tsp cloves
- :chestnut: 1 tsp allspice

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 Whisk
- 1 small bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Whisk the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg (optional), cloves, allspice, and black pepper together in a small bowl. The ground
ginger can clump, so whisk it very well to rid any clumps.

### Step 2

Pour spice mixture into your desired jar that seals well. A small funnel makes this step a little easier.

### Step 3

This homemade pumpkin pie spice mixture will last in a tightly sealed container until the individual spices’
expiration dates, which is typically 1–2 years. Buy them all at once to ensure equal freshness and store at room
temperature in a dry place, like a cupboard, drawer, or pantry.
