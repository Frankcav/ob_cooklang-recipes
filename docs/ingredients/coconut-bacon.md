Preheat the oven to 250Â°F.

### Step 2

In a wide, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add the coconut chips, olive oil, chipotle powder, and salt. Toast
for 10 minutes, stirring continuously so the chips do not burn.

### Step 3

When the coconut chips area dark golden color, stir in the maple syrup and continue cooking until the chips are well
coated, another 2 minutes.

### Step 4

Transfer the coconut chips to an oiled baking sheet and toast them in the oven until they are crispy, 10 to 12 minutes.

### Step 5

Check every 3 to 4 minutes and turn the chips over to make sure they cook evenly.

### Step 6

When the coconut chips are dry and crisp, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely.

### Step 7

The coconut bacon can be stored in an airtight container or glass jar for up to 1 month outside of the refrigerator.
