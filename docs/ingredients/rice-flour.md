## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and impurities.

### Step 2

For an even finer flour, you can spread the rinsed rice on a baking sheet and let it air dry completely. This step is
optional but recommended.

### Step 3

Working in small batches, add the rice to your blender or spice grinder. Pulse until the rice is broken down into a fine
powder. This may take a few minutes, depending on your equipment.

### Step 4

If you want an extra-fine flour, sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger pieces. This step is optional.

!!! note

    Any kind will work (white, brown, long grain, short grain), but keep in mind that the type of rice will affect the
    texture of your flour.

!!! note

    The type of rice you use will affect the texture of your flour. For example, glutinous rice flour (made from sweet
    rice) will be stickier than flour made from long-grain rice.

!!! tip

    Overloading your blender or grinder can result in unevenly ground flour.

!!! tip

    Over-grinding can cause the flour to heat up and become gummy.

!!! tip

    For a super fine texture, grind the rice once, then pass it through the grinder again.
