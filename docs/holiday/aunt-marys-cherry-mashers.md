## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the 7.2-ounce package Betty Crocker Home Style Fluffy White
Frosting Mix, confectioners' sugar, margarine, maraschino cherries, vanilla, and sweetened condensed milk.

### Step 3

Starting on low speed, then gradually turning the speed to medium, beat until the mixture has a fluffy consistency,
about 4 minutes.

### Step 4

Form the cherry mixture into 1 inch balls using a small (.75-ounce) cookie scoop. Place on the prepared baking sheet and
freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours.

### Step 5

In a medium saucepan, combine the chocolate almond bark broken up into smaller pieces, milk chocolate chips, finely
chopped dry-roasted peanuts, and vegetable oil and melt over medium heat, mixing to combine.

### Step 6

Working in batches, remove the cherry balls from the freezer and dunk them one at a time with a fork or spoon into the
chocolate mixture. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off over the pan, then return the balls to the parchment paper.

### Step 7

Refrigerate until completely hardened, about 20 minutes.

### Step 8

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
