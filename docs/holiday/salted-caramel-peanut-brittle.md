- :corn: 0.33 cup light corn syrup
- :glass_of_milk: 0.33 cup whole milk
- :icecream: 2 tsp vanilla bean paste

- :peanuts: 3 cups honey roasted peanuts

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 200°F. Line a sheet pan with a nonstick silicone mat and place it in the oven to warm.

### Step 2

In a large heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a candy thermometer, combine the granulated sugar, salted butter, light corn
syrup, and whole milk. Heat over medium high until the mixture reaches 300°F, whisking frequently and brushing the
sides of the pot with a pastry brush lightly dipped in water if you notice sugar stuck to the sides. This helps to
prevent the mixture from crystallizing.

### Step 3

Once the mixture registers 300°F, turn off heat. Add the vanilla bean paste and baking soda, and stir vigorously, the
mixture will bubble.

### Step 4

Stir in the desired amount of honey roasted peanuts and mix well.

### Step 5

Working quickly, pour the mixture onto the silicone mat on the warmed sheet pan and gently spread with a greased rubber
spatula into a thin and even layer.

### Step 6

Sprinkle with the Maldon salt and let it sit until completely cool, about 30 minutes. Break the brittle into pieces.
