## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray or line with parchment.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the light or dark brown sugar and margarine with a wooden
spoon or on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the egg whites and vanilla, then the chickpeas and semisweet chocolate
chips (and walnuts (optional) and raisins (optional), if using). Add the all-purpose flour, old-fashioned rolled oats,
baking soda, and kosher salt, and mix on low speed until a thick dough forms.

### Step 3

Drop the dough by the tablespoonful onto the baking sheet, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart. Press gently with a
fork to flatten. Bake until the cookies are golden brown and just set, 11 to 13 minutes; do not overbake. Transfer to a
cooling rack to cool.

### Step 4

Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
