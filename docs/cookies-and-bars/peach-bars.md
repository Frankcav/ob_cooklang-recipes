- 1 medium saucepan
- 1 fork
- 1 wire rack

## :pencil: Instructions - Crust

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper,
leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside.

### Step 2

Mix dough ingredients per [instructions][1] and chill. Roll out the pie dough on a baking sheet and cut off the
edges using a knife. Then chill the prepared sheet.

### Step 3

Score peaches along meridian into 4 quadrants using a knife.

### Step 4

Blanch peaches in boiling water for a few minutes until the skin starts to peel off and place them into a bath
of ice water.

### Step 5

Peel the peaches and cut them into bite sized pieces.

### Step 6

Add the demerara sugar, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, Diamond Crystal kosher salt, fresh lemon juice
and vanilla extract to the peaches in a large bowl and let it sit.

### Step 7

Add the all-purpose flour, old-fashioned rolled oats, demerara sugar, ground cinnamon, Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and
unsalted butter to a bowl and mix together with your hands until there are no discrete pieces of butter left and 
there aren't any flowery bits.

### Step 8

Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside, within reach of the stove.

### Step 9

Strain the peach juice into a saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the juice begins thicken, about 4 to 6
minutes. While the peach juice continues to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan
and add to the bowl of cornstarch. Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and peach juice together until the cornstarch is
dissolved. Stir this mixture into the juice, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling
has thickened, about 10 minutes.

### Step 10

Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. An ice bath may be used to cool the pan.

### Step 11

Pour/spread the filling over the crust dough. Sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back
of a large spoon or flat spatula.

### Step 12

Bake for about 20 minutes at 425Â°F then turn down the oven to 350Â°F and bake for another 25 to 40 minutes or until the top
is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy peach specks!).

### Step 13

Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, you can
place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up.

### Step 14

Lift the bars out of the pan using the edges of the parchment paper lining and place the whole thing on a cutting board.
Slice squares with a sharp knife and, for neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut.

### Step 15

Cover and store leftover peach pie bars (with or without icing) at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.
