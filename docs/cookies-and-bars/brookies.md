## :pencil: Instructions - Brownies

### Step 1

Line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment or foil and heat oven to 350°F.

### Step 2

For the brownies, melt unsalted butter then stir in cocoa powder. Whisk in both granulated sugar and light brown sugar
and the salt then add the eggs and vanilla and beat well (secret to glossy brownies is to beat the eggs and sugar very
well.)

### Step 3

Add the all-purpose flour and mix until almost combined then fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips and finish the
batter off by hand with a spatula scraping the bowl down and mixing in any errant flour etc.

### Step 4

Transfer the brownie batter to your prepared pan and spread into a thin layer then set aside.

### Step 5

Cream the unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar on high for 3 to 4 minutes or until light and
fluffy, scraping the bowl down as needed.

### Step 6

Mix in the vanilla and egg and scrape the bowl down once more.

### Step 7

Add salt, baking soda, and baking powder then mix until combined.

### Step 8

Pour in the all-purpose flour and mix until almost combined then fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips, reserving a
handful to sprinkle on top later. Finish mixing the batter with your spatula then drop spoonfuls onto the brownie
batter. You don't need full coverage, it will be nice to see the brownie batter peaking through after baking.

### Step 9

Cover with foil and bake at 350°F for 20 minutes then bake another 20 minutes uncovered. Allow to cool before removing
from pan and cutting.
