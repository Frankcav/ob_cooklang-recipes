## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine the vegetable oil, confectioners' sugar, ground cardamom and rose water in bowl. Using a hand mixer, mix on
medium for 2 to 3 minutes until light and creamy.

### Step 2

Sift chickpea flour into the bowl and beat on low for 1 minute until the dough is no longer sticky.

### Step 3

Dust your work surface with some chickpea flour and knead the dough for 10 minutes until it is more workable. The dough
is very crumbly.

### Step 4

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside for 2 hours. Do not refrigerate.

### Step 5

Preheat oven to 300Â°F and line baking tray with parchment paper.

### Step 6

Roll out the dough on a dusted work surface until it is 3/4 inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 1 inch clover shaped
cookie cutter and place the cookies on the baking tray, spaced 1 inch apart. Reroll and repeat until all the dough is
used up.

### Step 7

Sprinkle chopped pistachios on top of each cookie.

### Step 8

Place cooking tray in middle rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies turn a light golden color.

### Step 9

Remove cookies from oven and let it cool on tray for 5 minutes. Then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool
completely. Be careful when you transfer the cookies as they crumble very easily.
