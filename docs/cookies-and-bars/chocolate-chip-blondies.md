## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8 x 8 pan with parchment paper and set aside.

### Step 2

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted unsalted butter and brown sugar. Add the egg and egg yolk, and vanilla
extract and mix well.

### Step 3

In a separate bowl stir together the baking powder, salt, and all-purpose flour. Add the wet ingredients into the dry
and fold together until just mixed and no clumps of flour remain. Fold in the chocolate chips. Do not over mix. Leave some chocolate chips for the topping.

### Step 4

Pour the batter into your prepared pan, spreading into an even layer. Sprinkle the left over chocolate chips on top.

### Step 5

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the blondies are golden brown, set on the edges and have puffed up. The middle will
still be undercooked, but they will continue to cook as they cool!

### Step 6

Once the blondies are cool, cut into 9 squares for big blondies, or 16 squares for smaller portions and enjoy!
