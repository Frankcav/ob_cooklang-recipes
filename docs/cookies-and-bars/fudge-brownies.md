- :salt: 1 tsp salt
- :dash: 0.5 tsp baking powder
- :hot_beverage: 0,5 tsp espresso powder

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 9" x 13" pan
- 1 parchment
- 1 bowl
- 1 9" x 13" pan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. If you plan to turn the whole sheet of brownies out of the
pan at once, grease the pan, line it with parchment, and grease the parchment.

### Step 2

Crack the 4 eggs into a bowl, and beat them at medium speed with the Dutch-process cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso
powder, and vanilla for about 1 minute, or until smooth. You can do this while you're melting your unsalted butter (next
step).

### Step 3

In a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, or in a saucepan set over low heat, melt the butter, then add the granulated
sugar and stir to combine. Or simply combine the butter and sugar, and heat, stirring, until the butter is melted.
Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110°F to 120°F), but not bubbling; it'll
become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will help
produce a shiny top crust on your brownies.

### Step 4

Add the hot butter and sugar mixture to the egg and cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.

### Step 5

Add the all-purpose flour and chocolate chips, stirring until smooth. Again, adding the chips helps produce a shiny top
crust.

### Step 6

Spoon the batter into a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan.

### Step 7

Bake the brownies for 28 to 32 minutes, until the edges feel set, and the center should look very moist, but not
uncooked. When testing to see if brownies are done, take a toothpick or the tip of a sharp knife and carefully poke it
into the center of the pan, digging around just enough to see the interior. You should see moist crumbs, but no uncooked
batter. Yes, you'll be left with a small divot in the center of your brownies; just cut around it when you're cutting
the brownies into squares.

### Step 8

Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack before cutting and serving.

### Step 9

Store any leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.

!!! note

    This recipe is written using Dutch-process cocoa. If you use natural cocoa, your results may be different; the
    brownies may taste slightly acidic, and might be denser.
