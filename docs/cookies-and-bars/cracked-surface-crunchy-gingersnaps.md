## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a heavy-duty mixer, beat 1.75 cups (349 g) of the granulated sugar and the unsalted butter until fluffy. Add the 1/4
cup molasses and beat to blend in well. Add the egg and beat on low just to blend in.

### Step 2

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 Tbsp ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon,
1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Add this dry mixture to the mixer and blend on lowest speed. Cover and chill dough
for at least 1 hour or overnight.

### Step 3

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

### Step 4

Cover a baking sheet with release foil, or parchment lightly sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.

### Step 5

Roll the dough into 1.25 inch balls. Place the remaining 1/4 cup (51 g) granulated sugar in a small bowl and roll each
ball in sugar. Place the baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake until edges just begin to color, about 10 minutes, but check
on them at 8 minutes.

### Step 6

Remove the foil and cookies to a rack to cool completely.
