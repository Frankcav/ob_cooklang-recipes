!!! tip

    You can use dark sweet cherries (fresh or frozen) instead of sour cherries. Reduce the sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup
    (67 g) and add another 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Still, if I had to choose, I would use sour cherries here.

## :pencil: Instructions - Crust & Topping

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper,
leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside.

### Step 2

Whisk the all-purpose flour, 1 cup (85 g) whole rolled oats, brown sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and
salt together in a medium bowl. Add the melted unsalted butter and vanilla, and stir until the mixture resembles moist
crumbly sand and no dry spots remain.

### Step 3

You will have a little more than 3 cups of crust mixture, or about 520 g. Press 2/3 of the mixture (about 2 cups/345 g)
into the prepared baking pan. Press it into the pan (with your hands, a large spoon or spatula, or the bottom of a
measuring cup) to form a crust. Bake for 10 minutes, and then remove from the oven to slightly cool.

## :pencil: Instructions - Filling

### Step 4

Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside, within reach of the stove. In a medium saucepan set over medium
heat, combine the sour cherries, granulated sugar, and lemon juice.

### Step 5

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release their juices, about 4 to 6 minutes. While the cherries
continue to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan and add to the bowl of
cornstarch. Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and cherry juice together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir this
mixture into the filling, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling has thickened, about
10 minutes.

### Step 6

Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract.

### Step 7

Pour/spread the filling over the warm crust. Stir 2 Tablespoons whole rolled oats into the remaining crumble mixture,
then sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back of a large spoon or flat spatula.

### Step 8

Bake for about 40 to 50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few
jammy cherry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes.

### Step 9

Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, you can
place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up.

## :pencil: Instructions - Icing

### Step 10

Whisk the icing ingredients together. Add whole milk to confectioners' sugar and almond extract to thin it out, if
desired. Drizzle over cooled bars.

### Step 11

Lift the bars out of the pan using the edges of the parchment paper lining and place the whole thing on a cutting board.
Slice squares with a sharp knife and, for neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut.

### Step 12

Cover and store leftover cherry pie bars (with or without icing) at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.
