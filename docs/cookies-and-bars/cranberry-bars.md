## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9 X 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an
overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.

### Step 2

Make the crumble mixture for the crust and topping: Whisk the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt,
and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add the cold cubed unsalted butter and using a pastry cutter, two forks, or a
food processor, cut in the butter until all the flour is coated and resembles pea-sized crumbles. This takes at least 5
minutes of cutting in with a pastry cutter.

### Step 3

Whisk the egg, milk, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Pour over the flour/butter mixture and gently mix together
until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand.

### Step 4

You will have about 6 cups of the crust/crumble mixture. Set 2 cups aside. Pour the remaining into the prepared pan and
flatten down with your hands or a flat spatula to form an even crust. It will be a little crumbly, which is ok. Set
aside. (Almonds will be used in the topping in the next step.)

### Step 5

Cranberry Filling: Mix the fresh or frozen cranberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, orange zest, and fresh orange
juice. Spread over the crust. Sprinkle the remaining crumble mixture all over the cranberries. Sprinkle the sliced
almonds (optional) all over top.

### Step 6

Bake for about 40 to 50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few
jammy cranberry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the
pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, I stick the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up.

### Step 7

Make the icing and cut into squares: Whisk the fresh orange juice, confectioners' sugar together. Add more orange juice
to thin out, if desired. Drizzle over cooled bars, then cut into squares.

### Step 8

Cover and store leftover cranberry bars (with or without icing) at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week.
