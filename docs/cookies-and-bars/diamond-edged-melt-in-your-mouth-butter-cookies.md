## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a heavy-duty mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the European style unsalted butter, granulated sugar, 1/2 tsp
salt, and 1/2 tsp almond extract until light and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and beat with each addition,
just to blend in thoroughly.

### Step 2

On a low speed, beat in the all-purpose flour, scraping down the bowl twice. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each
into a log about 1.5 inches in diameter.

### Step 3

Sprinkle coarse sugar on wax paper, the length of the rolls and about 4 inches wide. Brush a roll lightly with beaten
egg, then roll in sugar to coat well. Repeat with each roll. Wrap each roll individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate
at least 2 hours or overnight.

### Step 4

About 30 minutes before you are ready to bake, place a shelf in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

### Step 5

Cover a heavy baking sheet with release foil or parchment sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Slice cookies into 3/8
inch slices and arrange about 1 inch apart on the sheet.

### Step 6

Place the baking sheet on the arranged shelf. Bake one sheet at a time until the edges just begin to brown, about 14
minutes. Allow to cool on the sheet for 2 minutes, and then remove to a cooling rack.
