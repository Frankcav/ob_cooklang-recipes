## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place candied orange peel in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Cover and set aside.

### Step 2

For the dough: Beat together the granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar, orange citrus oil, table salt, and vanilla and
Fiori di Sicilia until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

### Step 3

Add unsalted butter and beat on medium-low speed until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape the bowl, add egg, and beat until
combined, about 1 minute.

### Step 4

Strain the orange peel and press gently to remove any excess moisture.

### Step 5

Add all-purpose flour and orange peel, and beat on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds.

### Step 6

Transfer dough to a clean work surface and divide in half (about 500 g per piece). Shape each half into an 11" log.

### Step 7

For the topping: Spread the sparkling sugar across the middle of a piece of parchment, then roll each log in the sugar
to completely coat.

### Step 8

Transfer each log into the bottom of a Slice-and-Bake Cookie Dough Keeper. Cover with the lid and refrigerate until very
firm, 1 to 2 hours.

### Step 9

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400°F.

### Step 10

Take one log of dough out of the refrigerator, remove from Dough Keeper, and slice into ¼"-thick rounds. Rotate the log
about 90° every few slices to maintain a neat circular shape.

### Step 11

Transfer slices to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, placing the cookies about 2" apart.

### Step 12

Bake for 14 to 18 minutes, until edges are golden brown. Let cookies cool on the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer
to a rack to cool completely before serving. Repeat with remaining dough.
