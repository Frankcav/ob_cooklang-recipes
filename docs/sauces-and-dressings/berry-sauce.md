| 1.75 cups | 10 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- 100 g granulated sugar
- 57 g water
- 170 g frozen raspberries
- 170 g frozen blackberries
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 pinch salt

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium saucepan
- 1 heatproof flexible spatula

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
with a heatproof flexible spatula until the sugar dissolves to form a clear syrup, about 3 minutes.

### Step 2

When it comes to a boil, stop stirring and cook the mixture, swirling the saucepan occasionally, until large, glassy,
slow-moving bubbles form across the entire surface, about 2 minutes.

### Step 3

Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully add the frozen raspberries and frozen blackberries (plus any juices).
Stir the mixture to combine, which will cause the sugar to harden in some places.

### Step 4

Return the saucepan to medium-high heat and stir, mashing the berries against the saucepan and scraping the bottom and
sides with the spatula, until any hardened bits of sugar dissolve and you have a smoothish sauce with some pieces of
berries floating around, about 5 minutes.

### Step 5

Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and salt.

### Step 6

Transfer the berry sauce to a lidded container and refrigerate until cold.
