## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

If using fresh tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Fill a large bowl halfway-full with ice cubes and
cold water. Using a sharp knife, cut a 1/4 inch deep X on one end of each plum tomato. Place the scored tomatoes into
the boiling water and cook until you see the skin starting to wrinkle and split, 1 to 2 minutes (be careful not to cook
too long, or the tomatoes will become soft and difficult to handle). Using a slotted spoon, lift the tomatoes out of the
pot and plunge them into the ice cold water bath. Let sit for a few minutes to cool, then transfer the tomatoes to a
cutting board and, using your hands, peel off their skins.

### Step 2

Cut the tomatoes into 1/2 inch chunks (discard the cores at this point) and transfer them, along with all of their
juices, into a Dutch oven or saucepan. Alternatively, you may use canned whole peeled plum tomatoes (alternative).

### Step 3

To the chopped tomatoes, add the unsalted butter, olive oil, yellow onions, garlic, salt, and granulated sugar. Bring to
a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1.5 to 2.5 hours, stirring occasionally and
mashing the tomatoes, until the sauce is no longer watery.

### Step 4

Remove and discard the onions.

### Step 5

Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash any large chunks of tomatoes and garlic to make a slightly chunky and thick
sauce.

### Step 6

Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Before serving, stir in the chopped fresh basil.
