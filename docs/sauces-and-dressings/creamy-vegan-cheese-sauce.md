### Step 1

In medium pot, bring about 3 cups of water to a boil. Place peeled and diced potatoes, diced carrots, and diced onion in
pot and allow to cook until veggies are tender, approximately 15 minutes. Cooking time will vary based on how small the
veggies are diced.

### Step 2

When veggies are tender, drain and place them in blender.

### Step 3

Reserve 1 cup of the broth from the veggies, and add to blender. Add the raw cashews or white beans, nutritional yeast,
lemon juice, salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and blend until smooth.

### Step 4

Now, itâ€™s ready to use as a Loaded Potato Skins topping, nacho cheese dip, mac-n-cheese, topping for steamed broccoli,
or anything else you need a creamy, cheesy sauce in. It makes approximately 1 quart and can be stored in the
refrigerator up to 2 weeks.
