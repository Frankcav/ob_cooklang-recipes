### Step 1

In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter over medium heat until sizzling. Add the tomatoes, onion,

25 minutes.

### Step 2

Add 1/4 cup to 1 cup water, depending on the type of consistency, and the cumin. Using an immersion blender, process
until the sauce has a consistency of a chunky tomato sauce, 20 to 30 seconds.

### Step 3

Set the ranchero sauce aside.

### Step 4

If making ahead, the ranchero sauce will keep for 3 to 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
