## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Soak raw cashews for 2 hours or up to 12 hours.

### Step 2

Drain and rinse the cashews under cold water until the water runs clear.

### Step 3

Transfer the cashews to a high-speed blender and add the lemon juice, salt, and 1/2 cup water.

### Step 4

Blend until smooth and creamy.

### Step 5

Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

!! tip

    Use in place of coconut milk or dairy cream in pasta, soup, overnight oats, beverages (only if using the lesser
    amount of cashews - and strain for best texture), desserts, and anything else that would benefit from a creamy
    boost! Sadly, it doesnâ€™t work for making whipped cream.
