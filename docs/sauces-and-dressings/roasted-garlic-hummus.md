## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Cut off the top of the head of garlic (about 1/4") so that the tops of most of the cloves
are exposed slightly. Coat with a little olive oil and wrap securely in tin foil. Roast the garlic in the preheated oven
for 1 hours until golden brown and soft. The cloves should pop out of the head when squeezed when cooked. Remove from
the oven and allow to cool.

### Step 2

Using your fingers, squeeze the soft, roasted garlic out of each clove into a food processor. Rinse and drain the cooked
or canned chickpeas. Add them, [tahini][2], olive oil, warm water, lemon juice, and salt to the food processor and blend
until completely smooth.

### Step 3

Scrape the sides of the food processor to make sure it blends evenly. If you find that the hummus is too thick, you can
add additional olive oil at this time. Add in very slowly, allowing the mixture to combine fully before adding more
liquid.

### Step 4

Serve at room temperature with pita bread.
