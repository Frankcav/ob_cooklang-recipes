| 8-12 | 24 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :corn: 2 cups (186 g) masa harina
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :oil_drum: 1 tsp vegetable oil
- :hot_springs: 1.25 cups warm water

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large bowl
- 1 tortilla press
- 1 large plastic bag
- 1 rolling pin (alternative)
- 1 cast iron pan or griddle
- 1 damp dishtowel

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a large bowl mix the masa harina with the salt and 1 tsp of vegetable oil.

### Step 2

Add the warm water and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Then knead the dough with your hands for about a minute,
until it feels like play-doh.

### Step 3

Add 1 Tbsp of water at a time until the dough is soft and tacky but not sticky.

### Step 4

Cover bowl with a damp dishtowel and let rest for 10 minutes.

### Step 5

Now make 8 to 12 dough balls shaping them into the size of a golf ball. (You can use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop if you
have one.) If the dough feels dry, wet your hands and it will help soften the dough as you roll.

### Step 6

A tortilla press works best for pressing the tortillas into a 5-inch circle. To use one, cut a large plastic bag into 2
full-size, single pieces. Place one on the bottom plate, place one dough ball on top, then place another plastic piece
on top. Now press down the tortilla press and when you pull up, you will have a perfect tortilla. If you don't have a
tortilla press, place each dough ball in between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out to a 4- to 5-inch circle with
a rolling pin (alternative).

### Step 7

Heat up a cast iron pan or griddle with 1 tsp of vegetable oil to medium-high until shimmering. Use a paper towel to
wipe out the oil until there is a thin film on the bottom.

### Step 8

Put one tortilla in at a time. Cook on the first side for 45 seconds until the sides of the tortilla start to release.
Do not touch to tortilla to prevent ripping. Flip and cook for another 1 minute until edges begins to curl. Flip again
until puffy, about 30 seconds.

### Step 9

Wrap cooked tortillas in a damp dishtowel to keep them soft until you serve them.
