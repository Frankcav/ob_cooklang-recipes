## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 saucepan
- 1 extra virgin olive oil
- 1 non-stick skillet or pan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a saucepan, add vegetable broth or water. Add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of kosher salt. Bring
to a boil.

### Step 2

Now, toast the couscous. In a non-stick skillet or pan, heat about 1 to 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. Add the couscous
and toss around with a wooden spoon until golden brown. This is an optional step but can really adds a great nutty
flavor.

### Step 3

Stir couscous in the boiled liquid quickly and immediately turn the heat off. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes or until
couscous has completely absorbed the broth or water.

### Step 4

Uncover and fluff with a fork.

### Step 5

You can serve couscous plain, or mix in spices and herbs to give it more flavor. If you like, add in a pinch of cumin
(optional), sautéed garlic(optional), chopped green onions (optional), and fresh herbs (optional) or your choice.
Enjoy!
