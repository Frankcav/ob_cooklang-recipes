## :salt: Ingredients

- :broccoli: 1 head cauliflower
- :droplet: 1 cup water
- :ear_of_rice: 0.75 cup all-purpose flour
- :garlic: 1 Tbsp garlic powder
- :onion: 1 Tbsp onion powder
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :butter: 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- :hot_pepper: 1 cup Frank's Hot Sauce
- :maple_leaf: 1 Tbsp maple syrup or agave

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large baking sheet
- 1 parchment paper
- 1 large bowl
- 1 saucepan

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray generously with oil.

### Step 2

Wash and cut cauliflower into bite sized pieces.

### Step 3

In a large bowl, add water, all-purpose flour, garlic powder and onion powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.

### Step 4

Add the cauliflower to the batter in the bowl, and toss to combine and really coat the cauliflower. Remove the pieces of
cauliflower, one by one, and tap off the excess batter a few times on the side of the bowl.

### Step 5

Place on the prepared baking sheet and make sure they are not touching each other, or they will all get stuck together
as they bake. Spray the tops with oil, this will help them get super crispy.

### Step 6

Bake for 20 minutes. Flip them over and bake for 15 minutes more, until golden and crispy.

### Step 7

While the cauliflower are baking, prepare the hot sauce mixture. Melt the unsalted butter in a saucepan on the stove
over medium heat. Once melted, add the Frank's Hot Sauce, maple syrup or agave and stir. Set aside.

### Step 8

Once the cauliflower have cooked and are crispy, toss the florets with the sauce in a large bowl, then return to the
pan. You can serve them immediately, or to make them crispier, put them back in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. If you
want them super crispy, leave the buffalo sauce on the side for dipping as you go.

### Step 9

Serve with [ranch dressing][2].

!!! note

    To make them extra-crispy, roll the cauliflower in panko breadcrumbs (you will need about 1.5 cups) once they are
    coated in the flour/milk mixture. Then bake per the instructions.
