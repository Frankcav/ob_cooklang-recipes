## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To make the starter: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

### Step 2

In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the bread flour, kosher salt, instant yeast, and cool
water to make a shaggy dough, then use your hand to knead gently until thoroughly combined. (This may take about a
minute; it's quite stiff.) Cover the bowl and let the starter rest at room temperature for 4 to 14 hours; it should
expand.

### Step 3

To make the dough: Add all the starter, room temperature water, barley malt syrup or dark brown sugar (alternative),
instant yeast, salt, bread flour in the order listed to the bowl with the starter. Mix to bring the dough together, by
hand or at low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Next, knead the stiff dough until it’s supple and
elastic. This will take up to 15 minutes by hand or 8 to 10 minutes at medium-low speed with a mixer.

### Step 4

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and let it rest, covered with a reusable cover or plastic wrap, until it
doubles in bulk. This will take about 2 to 2.5 hours depending on the warmth of your kitchen.

### Step 5

Turn the dough out onto a clean surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into eight equal pieces.

### Step 6

To preshape the dough: Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the edges into the center. Pinch to seal and set
aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

### Step 7

Starting with the first piece of dough you shaped, place it seam-side down on an unfloured surface. Use your cupped
fingers and palm to roll the dough into a tight ball, moving your hand in a circular motion. The dough should stick
slightly to the surface in order to create tension to yield a smooth exterior. If the dough is unmanageably sticky, add
a very light dusting of flour; if the dough slides around on the surface without tightening, use a damp towel to clean
and moisten the surface and try again.

### Step 8

Once shaped into a tight ball, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of
dough.

### Step 9

Cover the preshaped dough and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

### Step 10

Line a baking sheet with parchment and lightly grease the parchment; or sprinkle the parchment lightly with cornmeal,
semolina, or farina, to prevent the bagels from sticking.

### Step 11

To shape the bagels: Working with one piece of dough at a time, use your finger to poke a hole through the center.
Gently rotate the dough to expand the hole to 2" to 3" in diameter, forming a ring shape. Place the shaped bagel onto
the prepared baking sheet. The hole will close up a bit; that’s OK.

### Step 12

Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the bagels on the baking sheet in a 3-2-3 arrangement to allow them to
fit nicely on one pan.

### Step 13

Cover the bagels with a reusable cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rest until they feel slightly puffy
to the touch, about 30 minutes.

### Step 14

While the bagels are resting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Combine the water and barley malt syrup or honey in a wide,
shallow pot; the water should be at least 1.25" deep. Bring the mixture to a boil.

### Step 15

To boil the bagels: Add bagels to the water two or three at a time to avoid crowding. Boil for 60 seconds, then use a
dough whisk or slotted spoon to turn the bagels over. Boil for another 60 seconds before removing from the water and
placing on the prepared pan.

### Step 16

If adding a topping, such as Everything bagel topping (optional), brush each bagel with the egg and water (egg wash) and
dip into a bowl of your desired topping before transferring back to the pan.

### Step 17

Bake the bagels until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Rotate the pan (front to back, back to front) halfway through
baking to ensure even browning.

### Step 18

Remove the bagels from the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack to cool.

### Step 19

Storage information: Prepared bagel sandwiches can be stored, well-wrapped in foil, in the refrigerator for up to two
days or in the freezer for up to a month. (See “tips,” below, for reheating instructions.) Bagels that aren’t made
into sandwiches can be stored, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days, or frozen for longer storage.

!!! tip

    To bake your bagels first thing in the morning: Prepare the dough up through step 4 (complete the kneading process)
    and allow it to rise for just 1 hour. Continue following the recipe through step 11 (shaping the bagels).
    Immediately place the baking sheet with the prepared bagels, covered, into the refrigerator overnight (8 to 12
    hours). The next morning, continue the recipe as written starting at step 14 (preheating the oven). Leave the
    bagels in the refrigerator until the water bath is boiling and the oven is preheated.
