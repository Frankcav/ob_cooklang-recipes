## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

To make the dough: Weigh your all-purpose flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any
excess. In a large bowl (a 3-quart bowl with a lid works great), whisk together the flour, salt, granulated sugar, and
yeast.

### Step 2

Add the lukewarm water and olive oil and stir — with a spatula, bowl scraper, dough whisk, or your hands — until the
mixture is thoroughly combined and homogeneous; there should be no dry patches or lumps. Cover the bowl and set it aside
for 15 minutes.

### Step 3

Perform the first bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a section of dough from one side of the bowl, then lift it up and
press it into the center. Repeat this motion, grabbing a new section of dough each time, until you've made a full circle
around the bowl, about 8 to 12 times. Once you’ve circled the bowl, flip the dough over in the bowl so that the smooth
side is up; the first bowl fold is now complete. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

### Step 4

Note: You’ll be doing this 3 more times over the next 45 minutes, each time further developing the dough’s strength.

### Step 5

Repeat the bowl fold for a second time. (Remember to use a wet hand to prevent the dough from sticking!) At this point,
the dough should feel smoother and tighter. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

### Step 6

Repeat the bowl fold for a third time. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

### Step 7

Repeat the bowl fold for a fourth and final time; the dough should feel relatively strong.

### Step 8

Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature (70°F to 75°F) for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the dough
should have nearly doubled in size and will be very puffy; it may even have a few bubbles on the surface.

### Step 9

To prepare the pan: Once the dough has risen, spray the bottom and sides of a 9" square Fabulous Focaccia Pan with
nonstick spray. Cut a 3"-wide strip of parchment that's about 16" long. Lay the strip across the center of the pan,
leaving a few inches of overhang on 2 sides; press it firmly into the pan and crease the parchment where it meets the
sides of the pan to help it stay in place. (The parchment tabs will help you remove the focaccia from the pan later on.)

### Step 10

Spray the parchment with nonstick spray, then add 1 tablespoon (13 g) of the olive oil and tilt the pan to spread the
oil evenly across the bottom.

### Step 11

Use a bowl scraper or flexible spatula to gently transfer the risen dough to the center of the pan. Using your hand as
paddles (and a bowl scraper for assistance, if you need it) swiftly but gently flip the dough over so that it’s coated
in oil; try to handle the dough minimally to keep it from deflating.

### Step 12

Cover the pan and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 to 1.5 hours, until it’s marshmallowy and
jiggly; the dough should nearly fill the corners of the pan and be very close to the top edge.

### Step 13

Toward the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 475°F with racks in the upper and lower thirds.

### Step 14

Once the dough has risen, lightly coat your fingers in oil. Starting at one edge, press your fingertips into the dough
until they reach the bottom of the pan, creating dimples. Repeat this process, working your way from one edge to the
other, spacing the dimples about 1 1/2" apart. The goal is to thoroughly dimple the dough without deflating it — aim
for decisive yet gentle motions. If there are any large untouched areas of the dough, add additional dimples using one
finger.

### Step 15

To top the dough: Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon (13 g) olive oil all over the surface of the dough; it’s OK if it
pools in some dimples. Sprinkle evenly with flaky salt (use 1 generously rounded teaspoon Cyprus Flake Salt or 1/2
teaspoon Maldon).

### Step 16

Bake the focaccia on the lower rack for 15 to 18 minutes, until brown in the highest spots and golden in the crevices.
If necessary, move the pan to the top rack and broil briefly for the final 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully, to
achieve the desired color.

### Step 17

Remove the focaccia fro the oven. Using the parchment tabs as handles, lift the focaccia out of the pan and transfer it
to a wire rack or cutting board; remove the parchment strip. Turn off the oven and slide the focaccia back into the
oven, directly on the lower rack, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the sides are golden brown and crisp. Remove the focaccia
from the oven once again and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

!!! tip

    Focaccia is best enjoyed the day it's made. If storing leftovers, wrap the focaccia loosely in foil, keep it at room
    temperature, and reheat before serving.
