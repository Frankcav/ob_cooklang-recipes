| 4 | 8 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :microbe: 227 g [sourdough starter][2]
- :candy: 1 tsp granulated sugar
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :cup_with_straw: 0.38 tsp baking soda

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium-sized bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place the [sourdough starter][2] in a medium-sized bowl. Stir in the granulated sugar and salt, then the baking soda.
The batter should rise up and bubble a bit, becoming almost billowy.

### Step 2

Heat your griddle over medium-low heat; 300°F is perfect. Lightly grease the surface with cooking oil (if your pan
isn't non-stick), then melt a pat of butter atop the oil.

### Step 3

Lightly grease four English muffin rings (1" high and 4" across) and place on the griddle. Divide the batter evenly
among the rings. Each ring will take a generous 1/4 cup of batter; a generously heaped muffin scoop is the perfect tool
for this task. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the tops are set and full of small holes. Carefully flip the crumpets
over, remove the rings (they should pop right off), and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until they're golden on
the bottom. , Enjoy the crumpets warm, split and spread with butter and jam. Or toast to brown and crisp them before
serving.

### Step 4

Store any leftovers at room temperature for several days. Freeze, well wrapped, for longer storage.
