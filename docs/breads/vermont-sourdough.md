## :salt: Ingredients - Liquid Levain

- :ear_of_rice: 135 g all-purpose flour
- :droplet: 170 g cool water
- :microbe: 14 g ripe [sourdough starter][2]

## :salt: Ingredients - Dough

- :ear_of_rice: 660 g all-purpose flour
- :ear_of_rice: 93 g whole wheat flour
- :droplet: 440 g water
- :microbe: all of the levain
- :salt: 18 g salt

## :salt: Ingredients - Mix Ins (Optional)

- :herb: 2 Tbsp Rosemary
- :herb: 2 Tbsp Thyme
- :lemon: 2 Tbsp lemon zest

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 bowl
- 1 cylindrical shaped container
- 1 Dutch oven
- 1 cooling rack

## :pencil: Instructions - Levain

### Step 1

To make the liquid levain starter: Mix all of the ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl, or the bowl of a stand
mixer. Cover and let sit for 12 to 16 hours at room temperature. The mixture should bubble and expand.

## Step 2

Add all of the dough ingredients (except the salt) to the bowl with the levain. Mix briefly, just to 
combine. If you’re using a stand mixer, use the dough hook on first speed, mixing just until everything is incorporated.

## Step 3

Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes. This resting period is known as the autolyse, and gives the flour 
a chance to absorb the water, making the resulting dough easier to work with.

## Step 4

Sprinkle the salt over the dough. Mix it in and continue to mix for several minutes. The dough won’t be smooth and
elastic, but it should be cohesive and starting to feel a bit springy. Using a stand mixer and dough hook at medium speed
this will take about 2 to 3 minutes.

!!! tip

    Other mix ins can be incorporated at this step.

## Step 5

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let it rest and rise for 1 hour.

## Step 6

After 1 hour uncover the bowl and, using a bowl scraper or spatula, run the scraper or spatula down the inside far wall 
of the bowl. Bring the dough up from the bottom of the bowl, and fold it over on top of itself. Turn the bowl 90° and
repeat; repeat twice more (for a total of four times), turning the bowl 90° each time. This process, which helps develop
the dough, is called a fold. Re-cover the bowl, and let the dough rise for another 90 minutes, adding another fold after 
45 minutes if the dough doesn’t seem elastic and strong enough.

## Step 7

Gently deflate the dough and divide it into two pieces; each will weigh about 750 g. Shape each piece into a rough ball, 
cover, and let rest for about 20 minutes; this rest will make the loaves easier to shape.

## Step 8

After the rest, shape the two pieces of dough into rounds or oblong loaves. Place them on a piece of parchment or a
lightly greased baking sheet. If the dough seems very soft, for added support turn the loaves (seam side up) into two
floured brotforms, or into two bowls lined with floured smooth cotton dish towels.

## Step 9

Cover the loaves and let them rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature (68°F to 78°F is ideal). Or refrigerate the 
covered loaves overnight.

## Step 10

When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450°F for at least 45 minutes before baking. At the same time, place two 
lidded oven-safe baking pans (such as a cloche, Dutch oven, or long covered baker) into the oven to preheat. Make sure
the baker you choose is safe to be preheated empty, without anything inside.

## Step 11

When the oven is fully preheated, carefully transfer the loaves to your chosen bakers. Slash them several times across
the top to allow for expansion.

## Step 12

Cover the bakers and place them in the oven. Bake the bread for 30 minutes. Remove the covers and bake 10 to 15 minutes 
more, or until the bread is golden brown. Its internal temperature should register about 210°F on a digital thermometer.

## Step 13

Remove the bread from the oven and turn it out of the pans onto a rack to cool completely.

## Step 14

Store the bread at room temperature, loosely wrapped, for up to 5 days; freeze for longer storage.
