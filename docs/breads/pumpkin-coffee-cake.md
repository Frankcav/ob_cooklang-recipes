## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 9 x 9 baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease the pan with baking
spray.

### Step 2

Combine melted unsalted butter and granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl and stir until well-combined.

### Step 3

Add eggs, stir well.

### Step 4

Stir in [pumpkin puree][2], sour cream, and vanilla extract until well combined. Be sure to scrape down the sides and
bottom of the bowl to ensure that all ingredients are well combined.

### Step 5

In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, pumpkin spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt.

### Step 6

Using a spatula, gradually add dry ingredients and wet and stir gently until just combined — do not over-mix!

### Step 7

Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Set aside while you prepare the streusel topping.

### Step 8

Prepare the crumble by whisking together all-purpose flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, and cinnamon.

### Step 9

Pour the melted unsalted butter into the mixture and, using a fork, stir until crumbles form.

### Step 10

Evenly sprinkle streusel topping over the top of your pumpkin batter.

### Step 11

Transfer pan to oven and bake on 350°F (175°C) for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
clean.

### Step 12

Allow to cool before adding glaze.

### Step 13

If desired, make glaze by whisking together confectioners' sugar and milk. Start with 2 teaspoons of milk and add a
third if it isn't thin enough to drizzle. Stir in vanilla extract.

### Step 14

Drizzle over cooled pumpkin crumb cake.

### Step 15

Cut and serve. Enjoy!
