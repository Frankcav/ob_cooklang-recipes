## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Weigh your bread flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix the cool
water, instant yeast, salt, Everything Bagel Topping, and olive oil in a large bowl to make a sticky dough. Or beat in a
stand mixer for 3 minutes.

### Step 2

Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature overnight, or for at least 8 hours; the dough will become
bubbly and rise quite a bit, so make sure it's in a large bowl.

### Step 3

Lightly grease a 14" to 15" long lidded stoneware baker or 9" to 10" round lidded baking crock. Our bread baking crock
and bread pot are both great choices.

### Step 4

Turn the dough onto a generously floured surface; the dough will be slack. To shape the loaf, fold the dough over onto
itself using a bench knife or well-floured hands. Because the dough is slightly sticky, it's best to work quickly.

### Step 5

Place the dough in the prepared pan, smooth-side up.

### Step 6

Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, until a slight indentation remains when you poke it with your
finger.

### Step 7

Just before baking, spritz or brush the dough with water and sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon Everything Bagel Topping
over the dough. Using kitchen scissors, make several 1/2" deep cuts in a decorative pattern on the top of the dough to
allow the bread to expand.

### Step 8

Replace the lid on the pot and put it in a cold oven; set the temperature to 450°F.

### Step 9

Bake the bread for 50 minutes (start the timer once the bread goes into the oven), then remove the lid and continue to
bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until it's deep brown in color, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center
registers about 205°F.

### Step 10

Remove the bread from the oven, turn it onto a rack, and cool before slicing.

### Step 11

Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature for several days. For longer storage options, see our blog
post, Freezing no-knead bread dough, for details.
