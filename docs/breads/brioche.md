## :pencil: Instructions - Dough

### Step 1

Add all ingredients to the refrigerator so that they are cold when making the dough.

### Step 2

Weigh your all-purpose flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

### Step 3

To make the dough: In a medium bowl, mix together flour, dry milk, salt, and instant yeast.

### Step 4

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the cold eggs, cool water, then the dry
ingredients, (except the butter) to make a smooth, stretchy dough that cleans the sides of the bowl; this should take 7
to 10 minutes at medium speed.

### Step 5

If the dough looks too dry, add the granulated sugar earlier during mixing process. The sugar should be added later to
give the dough time to come together because the sugar acts as a liquefying agent.

### Step 6

Using a rolling pin, beat the cold butter to make it pliable.

### Step 7

Once the dough has developed some strength and elasticity, add one piece of the cold unsalted butter, about 28 g, and
mix at medium speed until it’s fully incorporated into the dough, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the bowl if necessary, then
continue adding the butter one piece at a time, mixing to incorporate fully before adding the next piece. This dough
takes longer than most to develop so be prepared to let the dough knead for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until it's
formed a soft, smooth ball. We don't recommend trying to knead this dough by hand.

### Step 8

Form the dough into a ball (it'll be very soft), place it in a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and it let rise for 1 hour.
Then refrigerate the dough for several hours, or overnight. This will slow the fermentation and chill the butter, making
the dough easier to shape.

### Step 9

Divide the chilled dough into 12 pieces to make mini-brioche (brioche buns); leave it whole for one large round brioche;
or divide it in half for two 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaves.

### Step 10

Place the dough into the greased pan(s) of your choice, cover lightly, and let rise for 2.5 to 3 hours, until it's
doubled and looks very puffy.

### Step 11

If you're making two loaves, it's fun to make simple three-strand braids, and set them in the loaf pans.

### Step 12

To bake a large, round brioche: Place the pan into a preheated 400°F oven. After 10 minutes, reduce the oven heat to
350°F and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes more. Check the brioche after 15 minutes; tent with aluminum foil if it
appears to be browning too quickly. Brioche should be a deep brown when done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will
read 190°F at the center using an instant-read thermometer. (It's easy to underbake since it browns so quickly!).

### Step 13

Remove the brioche from the oven, and after 10 minutes remove it from the pan to cool completely on a rack.

### Step 14

To bake the mini brioches: Place the pan(s) onto a baking sheet for easy handling, as shown; then nestle that baking
sheet into another baking sheet, to protect the buns' bottoms from over-browning. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F
oven for 15 to 20 minutes (tent after 10 minutes if they're browning too quickly).

### Step 15

Remove them from the oven, let stand for 5 minutes, then turn them out onto a rack.

## :pencil: Instructions - Loaves

### Step 16

To bake the loaves: Allow the loaves to rise until they've nearly reached the rim of the pan, about 3 hours. Set the
loaf pans on a baking sheet, for easy handling. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, tenting with foil
after 15 to 20 minutes. Bake until the internal temperature reaches at least 190°F in the center, and up to 205°F for
a crustier loaf.

## :pencil: Instructions - Glaze

### Step 17

To make the glaze: Combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt. Add enough heavy cream to make a pourable
consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the baked loaves, if desired.

!!! tip

    If you're baking the brioche as a braided loaf, add an extra egg yolk (optional) to the dough, reserving the white.
    Just before baking the risen loaves, whisk the reserved white with 1 tablespoon milk, brush on loaves, and sprinkle with
    pearl sugar or sparkling white sugar (optional).
