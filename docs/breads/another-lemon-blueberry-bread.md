- :lemon: 2 Tbsp lemon juice

- 1 parchment paper
- 1 medium bowl
- 1 electric mixer
- 1 small bowl

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a 9"x 5" loaf pan with parchment paper (or lightly grease with butter).

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt, and set aside.

### Step 3

Massage the lemon zest with the granulated sugar

### Step 4

Beat the lemon sugar mixture with the eggs until light and fluffy.

### Step 5

In the bowl of an electric mixer, blend together the melted unsalted butter and lemon sugar and egg mixture. Mix until
well combined.

### Step 6

Add thee vanilla, and lemon juice to the whole milk.

### Step 7

While slowly mixing, add flour mixture and milk mixture in two batches (some flour, then some milk, then the rest of the
flour and the rest of the milk). Stop mixing as soon as it's just combined.

### Step 8

Rinse off the frozen blueberries (if using fresh) so they have just a bit of moisture on them, then, in a small bowl
toss the blueberries and 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour. This flour coating will help prevent the blueberries from sinking to
the bottom of your loaf while baking.

### Step 9

Add the flour coated berries to the batter and gently but quickly stir, by hand, to combine.

### Step 10

Immediately pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of
the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in the pan for about 30 minutes, then move to a wire cooling rack with a baking
sheet below (to catch the glaze you're about to add).

### Step 11

Prepare glaze by simply whisking together the melted unsalted butter, confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and vanilla,
then pour glaze over the loaf. Allow to set a few minutes, then enjoy!
