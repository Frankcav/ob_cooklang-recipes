## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Lightly grease an 8" or 9" round cake pan.

### Step 2

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the Irish-style flour, bread flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, kosher
salt, and currants or raisins (alternative).

### Step 3

Using a mixer, a pastry fork or blender, or your fingers, work in the unsalted butter until it's evenly distributed and
no large chunks remain.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl (or in a measuring cup) whisk together the buttermilk and egg. Pour this mixture into the dry
ingredients and mix to combine. The dough will be stiff; if it's too crumbly to squeeze together, add another tablespoon
or two of buttermilk.

### Step 5

Knead the dough a couple of times to make sure it's holding together, then shape it into a ball. Flatten the ball
slightly, and place the loaf in your pan. Use a sharp knife to cut a 1/2" deep cross in the loaf.

### Step 6

Bake the bread for about 45 to 55 minutes, until it's golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean. Remove the bread from the oven and brush the top with melted butter.

### Step 7

Store for about 2 days, well wrapped, at room temperature; freeze for longer storage (up to about a month).

!!! tip

    Our Irish-style flour will result in a soda bread with superior flavor and texture. Substituting premium whole
    wheat or white whole wheat flour is fine, but you'll want to reduce the amount of whole wheat (alternative) to 2 1/4
    cups and substitute the bread flour with all-purpose flour (alternative).
