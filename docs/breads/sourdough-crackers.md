![Sourdough Crackers][1]{ loading=lazy }

| :fork_and_knife_with_plate: Serves | :timer_clock: Total Time |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------------: |
| 100 crackers | 55 minutes |

## :salt: Ingredients

- :microbe: 227 g sourdough starter
- :ear_of_rice: 113 g whole wheat flour
- :salt: 0.5 tsp flaky sea salt
- :butter: 57 g butter
- :herb: 2 Tbsp herbs (optional)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 plastic wrap
- 1 parchment
- 1 rolling pin
- 1 baking sheet
- 1 fork

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix together the sourdough starter, whole wheat flour, flaky sea salt, butter, and herbs (optional) to make a smooth
(not sticky), cohesive dough.

### Step 2

Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate
for 30 minutes, or up to a couple of hours, until the dough is firm.

### Step 3

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

### Step 4

Working with one piece of dough at a time, very lightly flour a piece of parchment, your rolling pin, and the top of the
dough.

### Step 5

Place the dough onto the floured parchment and roll it about 1/16" thick. It'll have ragged, uneven edges; that's OK.
Just try to make it as even as possible.

### Step 6

Transfer the dough and parchment together onto a baking sheet. Lightly brush with oil and then sprinkle the salt over
the top of the crackers.

### Step 7

Cut the dough into 1 1/4" squares; a rolling pizza wheel works well here.

### Step 8

Prick (dock) each cracker a couple of times with a fork; this will help keep them from puffing up like little pitas as
they bake.

### Step 9

Roll and cut the second piece of dough following the directions above.

### Step 10

Bake the crackers for 20 to 25 minutes, until they're starting to brown around the edges. Midway through, rotate the
baking sheets both top to bottom and front to back; this will help the crackers brown evenly.

### Step 11

When fully browned, remove the crackers from the oven and place the pans on a rack to cool.

### Step 12

Store crackers, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.

!!! tip

    Up to 2 tablespoons (18 g) aromatic seeds (a mix of fennel, mustard, and caraway seeds is particularly nice with
    rye crackers); or Everything Bagel Topping

!!! tip

    Up to 2 tablespoons dried herbs, or 1/4 cup (11 g) finely chopped fresh herbs

!!! tip

    4 teaspoons (9g) Pizza Dough Flavor, especially good with cheesy crackers (see below)

!!! tip

    About 1 tablespoon of your favorite garam masala blend

!!! tip

    Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup (28 g to 38 g) finely grated hard cheese (Parmesan, Asiago, extra-sharp aged cheddar) along with
    the dry ingredients. The more assertive the cheese, the more evident its flavor in the crackers.
