## :pencil: Instructions - Tangzhong

### Step 1

Combine water, whole milk, and bread flour in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.

### Step 2

Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on
the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to lukewarm.

### Step 4

Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine the tangzhong
with the bread flour, dry milk, granulated sugar, salt, instant yeast, whole milk, egg, and melted unsalted butter,
then mix and knead — by mixer or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms; this could take almost 15
minutes in a stand mixer.

### Step 5

Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 1.5 hours, until puffy but not
necessarily doubled in bulk.

### Step 6

Gently deflate the dough and divide it into four equal pieces; if you have a scale each piece will weigh between 170 g
and 175 g.

### Step 7

Flatten each piece of dough into a 5" x 8" rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter.
Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again (this time about 3" x 6") and, starting with a short end, roll them each
into a 4" log.

### Step 8

Place the logs in a row of four — seam side down and side by side — in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.

### Step 9

Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.

### Step 10

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Step 11

To bake the bread: Brush the loaf with milk and bake it for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown on top and a
digital thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 190°F.

### Step 12

Remove the loaf from the oven and cool it in the pan until you can transfer it safely to a rack to cool completely.

### Step 13

Store leftover bread, well wrapped, at cool room temperature for 5 to 7 days; freeze for longer storage.
