## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all-purpose
flour, instant yeast, King Arthur Easy Roll Dough Improver (optional), granulated sugar, salt, water, vegetable oil,
mixing to form a shaggy/rough dough.

### Step 2

Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by mixer (5 minutes) or by bread machine (set on the dough cycle) until it's
smooth.

### Step 3

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not
double in bulk. If you've used a bread machine, simply let the machine complete its cycle.

### Step 4

Turn the dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide it into 8 pieces.

### Step 5

Roll two to four of the pieces into 6" circles (the number of pieces depends on how many rolled-out pieces at a time can
fit on your baking sheet).

### Step 6

Place the circles on a lightly greased baking sheet and allow them to rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes, while you preheat
your oven to 500Â°F. (Keep the unrolled pieces of dough covered. Roll out the next batch while the first batch bakes.)

### Step 7

Place the baking sheet on the lowest rack in your oven, and bake the pitas for 5 minutes; they should puff up. (If they
haven't puffed up, wait a minute or so longer. If they still haven't puffed, your oven isn't hot enough; raise the heat
for the next batch.)

### Step 8

Transfer the baking sheet to your oven's middle-to-top rack and bake for an additional 2 minutes, or until the pitas
have browned.

### Step 9

Remove the pitas from the oven, wrap them in a clean dishtowel (this keeps them soft), and repeat with the remaining
dough.

### Step 10

Store cooled pitas in an airtight container or plastic bag.
