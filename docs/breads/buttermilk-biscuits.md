## :salt: Ingredients

- :glass_of_milk: 120 g buttermilk
- :rice: 113 g sour cream
- :ear_of_rice: 284 g all-purpose flour
- :dash: 12 g baking powder
- :cup_with_straw: 0.25 tsp baking soda
- :salt: 1.5 kosher tsp salt
- :butter: 113 g cold unsalted butter

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 small bowl
- 1 food processor
- 1 large bowl
- 1 rubber spatula
- 1 rolling pin
- 1 bench scraper

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). In a small bowl, whisk together the
buttermilk and sour cream.

### Step 2

In the bowl of a food processor, combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until
blended, about 2 seconds. Scatter cold unsalted butter evenly over flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse
meal and the largest butter pieces are about 1/4 inch at their widest, about 8 times. Transfer to a large bowl.

### Step 3

Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a rubber spatula, fold until just combined. Transfer the
dough to a floured work surface and knead until it just comes together, adding extra flour as necessary.

### Step 4

With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12 by 8 inch rectangle. Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the
dough over the center, then fold the left third over so you end up with a 12 by 4 inch rectangle. Fold the top third
down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 4 inch square. Press the square
down and roll it out again into a 12 by 8 inch rectangle. Repeat the folding process once more. (See notes for cheddar
cheese and scallion variation.)

### Step 5

Roll the dough again into a 10 by 6 inch rectangle (about 1 inch thick). Using a floured biscuit cutter, cut eight 2
1/2–inch rounds out of the dough. Transfer the rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch
apart. Form the dough scraps into a ball and knead gently 2 or 3 times, until smooth. Roll the dough out until it’s
large enough to cut out 4 more 2 1/2-inch rounds, and transfer to the baking sheet.

### Step 6

Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter and bake until golden brown and well risen, about 14 minutes,
rotating the pan halfway through. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.

!!! tip "Variation"

    To make cheddar cheese and scallion biscuits: In Step 4, sprinkle 6 ounces grated cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup sliced
    scallions over the 12- by 8-inch dough rectangle before folding it the second time, and continue as directed.
