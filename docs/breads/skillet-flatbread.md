## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.

### Step 2

Add the oil and ice water, and mix to make a soft, cohesive dough. Adjust with flour or water as needed. The dough
should be moist but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes.

### Step 3

Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet on the stovetop. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer in the
pan.

### Step 4

Divide the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces. Each piece should weigh about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces, about the size of a large
egg. Dredge each piece in flour, and roll to a rough circle or oval, about 1/4" thick. OR hand shape the pieces by
flattening between your palms.

### Step 5

Divide the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces. Each piece should weigh about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces, about the size of a large
egg. Dredge each piece in flour, and roll to a rough circle or oval, about 1/4" thick. OR hand shape the pieces by
flattening between your palms.

!!! tip

    Rye variation: Replace 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1 cup Perfect Rye Flour Blend and 2 teaspoons Deli Rye
    Flavor. All other ingredients remain the same. Serve with cream cheese, chives, tomato, thinly sliced onion and
    capers.

!!! tip

    Pizza bread version: Add 2 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor and 2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs or Pizza Seasoning to
    the flour mixture. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.
