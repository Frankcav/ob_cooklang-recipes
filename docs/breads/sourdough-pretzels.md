## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Prepare a baking sheet by spraying it with vegetable oil spray, or lining it with parchment paper. If you're not using
King Arthur Flour's brand, grease the parchment with vegetable oil spray to make double-sure the pretzels won't stick.

### Step 2

Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix and knead the dough
ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a cohesive, fairly smooth dough. It should be slightly sticky;
if it seems dry, knead in an additional tablespoon or two of water.

### Step 3

Cover the dough and let it rest for 45 minutes. It will rise minimally. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the
oven to 350°F.

### Step 4

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface, fold it over a few times to gently deflate it, then divide it
into 12 pieces, each weighing about 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 ounces.

### Step 5

Roll each piece of dough into an 18" rope. Shape each rope into a pretzel.

### Step 6

Dissolve the malt in the water. Brush the pretzels with the solution, and sprinkle lightly with coarse pretzel salt.

### Step 7

Bake the pretzels for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're a light golden brown.

!!! note

    This is correct; there's no need to let the shaped pretzels rise before baking.

### Step 8

Remove the pretzels from the oven, and brush with melted butter.
