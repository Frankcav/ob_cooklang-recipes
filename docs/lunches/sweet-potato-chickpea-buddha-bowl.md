## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C) and arrange quartered sweet potatoes and wedged red onions on a bare baking sheet.
Drizzle both with a bit of olive oil, making sure the flesh of the sweet potatoes are well coated and placed skin side
down on the sheet.

### Step 2

Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven flip sweet potatoes and add broccolini. Drizzle broccolini with a bit of oil
and season with a pinch each salt and pepper.

### Step 3

Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, then remove from oven and add kale. Drizzle kale with a touch more oil and season with
a pinch each salt and pepper. Bake for another 4 to 5 minutes then set aside.

### Step 4

While vegetables are roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with
cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano (optional), and turmeric (optional).

### Step 5

Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil (amount as original recipe is written // use half of total amount if altering batch size) and
chickpeas and sauté, stirring frequently. If they’re browning too quickly, turn down heat. If there isn’t much
browning going on, increase heat. I found 10 minutes total at slightly over medium heat was perfect.

### Step 6

Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set aside.

### Step 7

Prepare sauce by adding tahini, maple syrup, and lemon juice to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add 5 to 10 Tbsp
of hot water until a pourable sauce is formed. Set aside.

### Step 8

To serve: slice sweet potatoes into bite size pieces. Divide vegetables between 8 serving bowls and top with chickpeas +
tahini sauce.

### Step 9

Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep for a few days in the fridge.
