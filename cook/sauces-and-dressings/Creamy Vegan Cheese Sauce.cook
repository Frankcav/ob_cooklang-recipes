In #medium pot{}, bring about 3 cups of water to a boil. Place peeled and diced @potatoes{1%cup}, diced @carrots{1/4%cup}, and diced @onion{1/4%cup} in pot and allow to cook until veggies are tender, approximately ~{15%minutes}. Cooking time will vary based on how small the veggies are diced.

When veggies are tender, drain and place them in blender.
