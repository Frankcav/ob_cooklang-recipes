Pour @tomatoes{1%28-oz can} into a #large bowl{} and crush with a #fork{}. Pour 1 cup water into can and slosh it around to get tomato juice. Reserve.

In a #large skillet{} (do not use a deep pot) over medium heat, heat the @olive oil{1/4%cup}. When it is hot, add the peeled and slivered @garlic{7%cloves}. As soon as the garlic is sizzling (do not let it burn) add the tomatoes, reserved tomato water, @whole chili or red pepper flakes (optional){1%pinch} or TJ's Bamba Hot Pepper Sauce, @oregano{1/4%tsp}, and @kosher salt{1%tsp}. Stir.

Place the @basil sprig{1%large} (including stem) on the surface like a flower. Let it wilt, then submerge in sauce.

Simmer until sauce has thickened and oil on surface is a deep orange, about ~{10%minutes}.

Taste and season as needed. Discard basil and chile, if using.
