Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a #9"x 5" loaf pan{} with #parchment paper{} (or lightly grease with butter).

In a #medium bowl{}, whisk the @all-purpose flour{1.5%cups}, @baking powder{1%tsp} and @salt{1%tsp}, and set aside.

Massage the @lemon zest{2%tsp} with the @granulated sugar{1%cup}

Beat the lemon sugar mixture with the @eggs{2} until light and fluffy.

In the bowl of an #electric mixer{}, blend together the melted @unsalted butter{1/3%cup} and lemon sugar and egg mixture. Mix until well combined.

Add thee @vanilla{1/2%tsp}, and @lemon juice{2%Tbsp} to the @whole milk{1/2%cup}.

While slowly mixing, add flour mixture and milk mixture in two batches (some flour, then some milk, then the rest of the flour and the rest of the milk). Stop mixing as soon as it's just combined.

Rinse off the @frozen blueberries{1%cup} (if using fresh) so they have just a bit of moisture on them, then, in a #small bowl{} toss the blueberries and 1 Tbsp @all-purpose flour{1%Tbsp}. This flour coating will help prevent the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of your loaf while baking.

Add the flour coated berries to the batter and gently but quickly stir, by hand, to combine.

Immediately pour batter into prepared pan and bake for 55 to ~{65%minutes}, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in the pan for about ~{30%minutes}, then move to a wire cooling rack with a baking sheet below (to catch the glaze you're about to add).

Prepare glaze by simply whisking together the melted @unsalted butter{2%Tbsp}, @confectioners' sugar{1/2%cup}, @lemon juice{2%Tbsp} and @vanilla{1/2%tsp}, then pour glaze over the loaf. Allow to set a few minutes, then enjoy!
