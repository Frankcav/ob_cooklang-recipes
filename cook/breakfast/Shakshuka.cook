Pour the can of @whole peeled tomatoes{1%28-oz can} and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with @salt{} and @pepper{} and bring the sauce to a simmer.

Use your #large spoon{} to make small wells in the sauce and crack the @eggs{6%large} into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to ~{8%minutes}, or until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite the eggs cooking.

Garnish with chopped @cilantro{1%small bunch} and @parsley{1%small bunch} before serving.
