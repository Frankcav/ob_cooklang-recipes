To a #cast iron pan{} over medium heat, add @Greek Chickpeas with Parsley & Cumin{1%can} and all the oil in the can. When oil is hot, add the @red onion{1} and @red bell pepper{1}, and saut√© until the onions begin to brown and the peppers soften, about 5 to ~{10%minutes}, depending on the strength of your heat source. Season with @Smoked Paprika{1%tsp} and @21 Seasoning Salute{}.

Use a #spatula{} to create four individual pockets throughout the hash. Crack the @eggs{4} into each pocket. For eggs with a runny yolk, cook until egg whites have set, about 3 to ~{5%minutes}. For a firmer yolk, cook a few more minutes.
