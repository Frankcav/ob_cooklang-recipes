Rinse the @rice{1%cup} under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and impurities.

For an even finer flour, you can spread the rinsed rice on a #baking sheet{} and let it air dry completely. This step is optional but recommended.

Working in small batches, add the rice to your #blender or spice grinder{}. Pulse until the rice is broken down into a fine powder. This may take a few minutes, depending on your equipment.

If you want an extra-fine flour, sift it through a #fine-mesh sieve{} to remove any larger pieces. This step is optional.

Note: Any kind will work (white, brown, long grain, short grain), but keep in mind that the type of rice will affect the texture of your flour.

Note: The type of rice you use will affect the texture of your flour. For example, glutinous rice flour (made from sweet rice) will be stickier than flour made from long-grain rice.

Tip: Overloading your blender or grinder can result in unevenly ground flour.

Tip: Over-grinding can cause the flour to heat up and become gummy.

Tip: For a super fine texture, grind the rice once, then pass it through the grinder again.
