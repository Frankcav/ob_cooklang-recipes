#Whisk{} the @cinnamon{3%Tbsp}, @ginger{2%tsp}, @nutmeg (optional){1.5%tsp}, @cloves{1%tsp}, @allspice{1%tsp}, and @black pepper{1%pinch} together in a #small bowl{}. The ground ginger can clump, so whisk it very well to rid any clumps.

Pour spice mixture into your desired jar that seals well. A small funnel makes this step a little easier.

This homemade pumpkin pie spice mixture will last in a tightly sealed container until the individual spices’ expiration dates, which is typically 1–2 years. Buy them all at once to ensure equal freshness and store at room temperature in a dry place, like a cupboard, drawer, or pantry.
