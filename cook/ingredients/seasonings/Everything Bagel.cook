Combine @white sesame seeds{2%tsp}, @dried minced onion{1.5%tsp}, @dried minced garlic{1.5%tsp}, @black sesame seeds{1.5%tsp}, @sea salt{1%tsp}, and @poppy seeds{1/2%tsp} thoroughly and store in an #air-tight container{} at room temperature. Sprinkle on hard-boiled eggs, avocados, over salads, or anything else you wish!

Note: Don't make any ingredient substitutions that will change the texture of the ingredient -- like using granulated garlic instead of dried minced garlic. If the components aren't the same size and texture the mixture won't stay blended well and the taste will be off.

Note: I used toasted sesame seeds which gave the blend a slightly more pronounced sesame flavor. You can use either toasted or untoasted.

Note: If you don't want to buy black sesame seeds, you can substitute white sesame seeds and the flavor will be about the same.
