Preheat your oven to 400째F (205째 C). A toaster oven works great for this.

Peel and discard the papery outer layers of the @whole garlic bulb{1}. Leave intact the skins of the individual cloves of garlic

Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 to a 1/2 inch from the top of cloves. This exposes the individual cloves of garlic.

Place the garlic heads in a #baking pan{}, cut side up. (A muffin pan works great for this, as it keeps the garlic bulbs from rolling around.)

Drizzle a couple teaspoons of @olive oil{} over each exposed head, using your fingers to rub the olive oil over all the cut, exposed garlic cloves.

Sprinkle a pinch of @salt{1%pinch} over the top of the garlic head.

Cover the bulb with aluminum foil.

Bake at 400째F (205째C) for 30 to ~{40%minutes}, or until the cloves are lightly browned and feel soft when pressed.

Allow the garlic to cool enough so you can touch it without burning yourself. Use a small knife cut the skin slightly around each clove. Use a cocktail fork or your fingers to pull or squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins.

Eat as is (I love straight roasted garlic) or mash with a fork and use for cooking. Can be spread over warm French bread, mixed with sour cream for a topping for baked potatoes, or mixed in with Parmesan and pasta.
