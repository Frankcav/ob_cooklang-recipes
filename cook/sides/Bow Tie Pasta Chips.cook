Cook the @whole-grain bow tie pasta{2%cups} for half the time called for on the package.

Drain the pasta then toss with the @aquafaba{1%Tbsp}, @nutritional yeast{1%Tbsp}, @Italian seasoning{1.5%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp}.

If your air fryer basket is small, you will have to cook the chips in two batches (larger baskets may be able to do one batch). Cook at 390Â°F for ~{5%minutes}, then shake the basket and cook for 3 to ~{5%minutes} more or until crunchy.
